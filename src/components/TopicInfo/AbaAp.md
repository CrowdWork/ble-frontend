### Actions by and against Partners
**Order 6**

<u>Types of different legislation for companies</u>

* Business Name Registration Act
* Sole proprietorship (sue the person rather than the company e.g. Kofi Mensah doing business as AB Consult)

Under the Companies Act 1963: 
* Limited liability companies which can only sue and be sued through lawyers in the name of the company
*Partnership Act

Where two or more people do business as partners, they can sue and be sued in the name of the firm. But if the partnership is sued in the name of the firm, the defendant can request for the partners to provide their names under **Order 6** (this is unlike suing a limited liability where they cannot be forced to reveal the name of their shareholders or directors)

The writ can be served on any of the partners, one or more. Or it can be served at the principal place of business of the partnership and at that place it can be served on any person who is in control or management of the partnership. When it is served on a partner or at their place of business it is deemed as good service. A notice must be given when they are served Form 2 (Schedule of CI 47 pg 274)

When the writ is served the partners must enter appearance in their own names but the action will continue in the name of the firm.
