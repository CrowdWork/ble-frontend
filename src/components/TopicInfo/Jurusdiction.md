### Jurisdiction

The jurisdiction of a court is the authority of that court to entertain or decide a case. It connotes the limit or extent of the power of the court.

Jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a lower court by presumption or by implication _Hausa v Dawuda [1961] GLR 550_ / _Timitimi v Amabebe (1953) 14 WACA 374_. 

The District Court being a lower court, has no jurisdiction except that which is expressly conferred on it by statute. Parties cannot confer jurisdiction on a court. 

### Geographical Jurisdiction

This relates to the lower courts.

Judges in lower courts are confined geographically.

A magistrate who sits outside his district without authority, renders his decision a nullity. _Republic v District court Grade I, Korle Gonno; Ex parte Ampomah [1992-1993] GBR 196_


#### Jurisdiction cases: 

_Quist v Kwantreng [1961] 2 GLR 605_: 

A land case valued at over ¢200 was brought to the local courts in 1958 when the Local Courts Act 1958 was still operational. However, it kept being adjourned for various reasons until 1961. By that time the Courts Act 1960 had come into force, which stated that cases exceeding ¢200 could not be heard in the local courts. The defendants filed a motion objecting to the jurisdiction of the local court and also requested leave to file for an order to prohibit the local court hearing the case. Leave was granted, and a hearing for the prohibition order was heard in the High Court by Acolatse J. The High Court rejected the prohibition order and allowed the local court to continue with the case. Thus the local court decided the case. The defendants appealed this decision to the High Court requesting leave to also appeal the local courts jurisdiction to hear the matter. The defendant-respondents objected to their additional appeal ground arguing that Acolatse J had already ruled on the matter of jurisdiction and that if the High Court reheard that point it would constitute reviewing a decision or sitting as an appeal court to a decision of a court on the same level. 

Their appeal was heard by a differently constituted High Court, which included Ollenu J.  In respect of whether rehearing an argument about jurisdiction would constitute reviewing a fellow High Court decision or sitting on appeal on it, he took the view that the current appeal proceedings were different to the proceedings Acolatse J sat on which was finally determined. Acolatse J was asked to make a decision on a prerogative writ to prohibit the local court to hear the case for lack of jurisdiction. He declined to exercise his prerogative. Nothing precluded the appellants from including an objection to jurisdiction in their appeal to the decision of the local courts. <u>**An objection to jurisdiction can be brought at any stage of the proceedings**</u>.

In respect of the jurisdiction of the local courts, Ollenu J was of the opinion that since the statute did not expressly give the local court jurisdiction of cases over ¢200, it did not matter that Acolatse J recognized its jurisdiction by refusing to exercise his prerogative. His refusal to prohibit did not vest the local court with jurisdiction. **Consent of the parties to be tried in a certain court cannot also vest jurisdiction in that court <u>if the statute does not provide for consent.**</u>  In this case the parties neither consented nor was it in the statute. The appeal was allowed.

_Republic v Adansi Traditional Council ex parte Nana Akyia II and another [1974] 2 GLR 126_: 

The plaintiffs commenced chieftaincy proceedings against the defendants before a 21-member panel of the Adansi Traditional Council in October 1969. After several sittings, the council met, this time composed only of five members and four non-members and presided over by its chairman, and decided to adjourn the proceedings again. Before they adjourned, the council appointed a seven-member committee to go into the case. The parties to the dispute agreed to adopt the evidence already adduced and to continue the case by this newly appointed committee. After several sittings during which the rest of the evidence was heard, the committee delivered its judgment in favour of the defendants, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claim. 

Being dissatisfied with the judgment the plaintiffs moved the High Court for an order of certiorari to quash the proceedings and judgment of the Adansi Traditional Council on the main ground that the council had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter since no rule had been made at the time for the lodging of an appeal from the decision of a traditional council. The application was dismissed as being frivolous and untenable. 

The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal and for the first time objected to the jurisdiction of the Adansi Traditional Council to hear and determine the matter on the ground that the council was improperly constituted on the occasions when less than one half of the number of its membership sat to hear and determine the matter. The plea of jurisdiction was based on section 16 (3) of Act 81, which provided that: “No business except that of adjournment shall be transacted if less than one half of the total number of members are present”. Counsel for the respondents contended that since the parties had consented to the jurisdiction of the committee appointed by the council to go into the matter and inasmuch as the objection to the committee’s jurisdiction was not taken earlier at the hearing of the motion for certiorari in the High Court it was now too late for the appellants to canvass it at the Court of Appeal.

The following was held:  

(1) it was incontrovertible that the proper quorum for adjudicating a cause or matter affecting chieftaincy under section 16 (3) of Act 81 was a membership of not less than half of the total number of members of the traditional council present.  In the instant case the full membership of the council was 21; consequently at least eleven members of the present council would constitute a competent body to hear and determine a matter affecting chieftaincy and since the membership of the reconstituted committee of the Adansi Traditional Council heard the appellants' case, there was lack of jurisdiction in the committee and the sittings, proceedings and judgment of that committee were therefore null and void and of no effect whatsoever.

(2) **A plea as to the jurisdiction of an inferior court or tribunal could be taken and heard at any time even if the point was not raised in the court below** if it appeared to an appellate court that an order against which an appeal had been brought had been made without jurisdiction and it would never be too late to admit and give effect to the plea that the order was a nullity

(3) Where by reason of any limitation imposed by statute a court or tribunal was without jurisdiction to entertain any particular matter or action, **neither the acquiescence nor the express consent of the parties to the case could confer jurisdiction upon the court or tribunal nor could consent give that forum jurisdiction if a condition which went to jurisdiction had not been performed or fulfilled**.  In the instant case section 16 (3) of Act 81 prescribed that an adjudicating traditional council should consist of not less than half of the total membership for the purpose of transacting any business except an adjournment.  Consequently, a quorum of members less than half of the total membership as in this case was incompetent to adjudicate therein, notwithstanding the consent of the parties.


_Republic v High Court Koforidua Ex parte Bediako II [1998-99] SCGLR 91_: 

---

Note: Before reading the case brief below, take note that the Judicial Committees of the various traditional councils have sole jurisdiction to try causes or matters affecting chieftaincy. Matters affecting chieftaincy must first go through these forums before any appeal is made to the Supreme Court. Lower courts are <u>ousted</u> from hearing matters affecting cheiftaincy.

---

Nana Agyabeng II, the Chief of Soabe in the Akem Abuakwa Traditional Area, was summoned to appear before a panel of arbitrators headed by a divisional chief (the applicant in the instant proceedings) to answer destoolment charges preferred against him. He was found liable and declared destooled after the hearing. The destoolment proceedings and the decision of the panel were on 18 July 1996 quashed by the High Court as a nullity for want of jurisdiction under section 15(1) of the Chieftaincy Act 1971 (Act 370), on an application for certiorari brought by Nana Agyabeng II. The applicant brought the instant application for certiorari in the Supreme Court to quash the decision of the High Court for want of jurisdiction because the issue in the application brought before the High Court, relating to the status of Nana Agyabeng II, involved an inquiry into a cause or matter affecting chieftaincy.

Held: unanimously dismissing the application for certiorari

The High Court had rightly held that the panel, headed by the applicant as a divisional chief, had no jurisdiction under section 15(1) of the Chieftaincy Act 1971 to hear and determine the destoolment charges brought against Nana Agyabeng II because those proceedings constituted a cause or matter affecting chieftaincy. The High Court had therefore properly quashed as a nullity for want of jurisdiction, the destoolment proceedings brought before the panel

*Per Aikins JSC*: I have read the ruling of the High Court Judge over and over again, but I have not been able to find that he had determined that Nana Agyabeng II was a chief… What he had considered was whether the applicant Oseawuohene had jurisdiction to entertain, hear and decide the destoolement charges preferred against Nana Agyabeng II.

*Per Sophia Akuffo JSC*: To my mind, the mere fact that the question of whether or not a person is a chief rears its head during an application for certiorari before the High Court does not necessarily constitute the matter as one affecting chieftaincy for the purposes of section 57 of the Courts Act, 1971 where such a question arises as a matter secondary to the determination of the fundamental question of whether or not an inferior body had the jurisdiction to do something, and does not give rise the necessity to make a final determination of such status and whether or not such a person has been properly nominated, elected and installed according to the applicable custom or usage. In order to constitute a matter as one affecting chieftaincy, it must, in my view, be the determination of which, unless overturned on appeal, would settle once and for all, a chieftaincy matter or dispute.
