###Factors to be considered before issuing a writ of summons to commence an action:

a)	**Parties to an action**: who is the right Plaintiff? Who is the right Defendant?

b)	**Capacity** – e.g. if someone says they are executors they have to produce the probate for you to ensure that person has been named in the will as an executor; for administrator, must produce letters of administration.

c)	**Cause of action** - a series of events that have happened and give the Plaintiff a right to go to court to sue the Defendant. Cause of action must have accrued.

d)	**Venue** – Order 3 deals with venue. This will depend on the amount in question or the geographical location of the plaintiff and defendant. In land matters a writ must be filed or issued in the region where the land is situated. 

e)	**Jurisdiction** - which court has jurisdiction over the matter? Chieftaincy matters must be referred to the Traditional Councils, Regional or National House of Chiefs.

f)	**Any other Legal conditions precedent**

###Relevant Cases

**Capacity**

_Kwan v Nyeini  [1959] GLR 67_: 

>Kojo Kwan and Osei Kojo were members of the same family, whose head was the said Osei Kojo. Between 1953 and 1954 the members of this family purported to remove Osei Kojo as head. Osie Kojo caused an arbitration to be held on the matter of his removal and the arbitrators decided that his removal was not in order. Not withstanding this decision the family, still not satisfied, appointed Kojo Kwan as another head. Osei Kojo mortgaged four family farms to Kwesi Nyieni. Kojo Kwan then instituted proceedings against Osei Kojo and Kwesi Nyieni asking for declarations that the farms were mortgaged by Osei Kojo without the knowledge and consent of the family. It was held that Osei Kojo was still the head of the family and Kojo Kwan was not a head, even though it was correct that the mortgage was without the knowledge of the principal members of the family. It was also held in two further appeals ending up in the Court of Appeal that, as he was not the head of the family, Kojo Kwan was not the proper person to institute a suit for recovery of family land except in exceptional cases e.g. where the head of family is deliberately disposing of family land without consent or simply not making a move to save endangered family land.  

_In re Ashalley Botwe Lands: Adjetey Agbosu & Ors v Kotey & Ors [2003-2004] 1 SCGLR 420_

>The head of family has capacity to sue and be sued on behalf of the family. 

**Legal Conditions Precedent**

_Accam v Gbettey [2013-2014] 1 SCGLR 343_

>Section 127 Local Government Act (Act 462) states that the District Assembly must be given one-month notice before any action is commenced against them. 

According to **Order 4 rule 1** of C.I 47 any person may begin or carry on proceedings in person or by a lawyer.

Corporate bodies however, _must_ act through lawyers. (**Order 4 rule 2**).

People with disabilities as defined by **Order 5 rule 1(1)** shall be represented by their next friends or guardians ad litem. These guardians and friends shall be responsible for taking any step in the proceedings for the person with a disability. (**Order 5 rule 1(3)**).

Guardians ad litem are adults who are legally responsible for protecting the well-being and interests of their ward.

A 'Next friend' is a common law term for a person who represents another person who is under disability or otherwise unable to maintain a suit on his or her own behalf and who does not have a legal guardian.

Next friends and guardian ad litems  must act through lawyers. (**Order 5 rule 1(4)**)


###Writ of Summons

By definition a writ of summons is a judicial form or document issued out of the registry of a court at the instance of a plaintiff for the purpose of giving a defendant notice of a claim made against him or her and calling upon the defendant to enter appearance to admit or deny the claim within 8 days.

<u>**Cause of Action**</u>

A party intending to go to court to litigate must have a cause of action and the cause of action must have accrued. 

An action in court is aimed at vindicating a legal right and such rights can only arise if certain material facts exist. 

For example, an action in Detinue (an action in tort) for the recovery of goods wrongfully detained; the existence of the following facts must have occurred:

* The goods were in possession of the person solely
* That the person sued without any lawful excuse or consent of the owner, took away the goods. 
* That the owner had demanded the return of the goods but the person sued has refused to return the goods. 

The totality of these material facts constitute the cause of action and establishes a claim. 

NB: It is important to know the cause of action because the writ of summons should disclose this. 

Every writ of summons must be endorsed with a substantive claim, remedies, and reliefs sought. If it only contains an ancillary relief, it will be struck out. See _Republic v. High Court Tema Ex Parte Owners of Me MV Essco Spirit [2003-2004] SCGLR 689_ 

_Ampratwum Manufacturing Company Ltd v Divestiture Implementation Committee [2009] SCGLR 692_ 

> This case reiterated the principle that the action must be brought against the appropriate party. In this case, it was stated that DIC was not the proper person to be the defendant in this case. 

>In holding (1) it was said: "As a matter of law and on of fact of practice, the DIC was a mere advisory executive agent of the Government of Ghana without authority to take decisions of finite nature; and it had no capacity to sue or to be sued in its own right. As such agent of the state, civil proceedings against it must be instituted against the Attorney General as the defendant." 

>It was stated that it is fundamental in litigation that parties must commence action against relevant parties to the suit. To institute an action against a party, one must have a cause of action against the defendant.

Also note that if, for instance, a writ does not include a substantive claim, but the statement of claim contains the substantive claim, the statement of claim is said to have ‘cured’ the defect on the writ. 

<u>**Contents of the Writ – Order 2 Rule 3**</u>

* A writ must bear the name and city of the court. 

* Names, residential, and occupational addresses of the parties must be on the writ. 

* The writ must be indorsed with a statement of the nature of the claim, relief or remedy sought in the action.

* **Order 2 Rule 3(3)** provides that where the plaintiff’s claim is a liquidated demand only the writ shall include, in addition to the amount claimed, a statement that further proceedings will be stayed if within the time limited for appearance the defendant pays the amount claimed to the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s lawyer, or into the court if the plaintiff or defendant is resident outside the country.

<u>**Indorsement as to capacity and address (in relation to representatives)**</u>

* By **Order 2 Rule 4**, where a plaintiff sues in a representative capacity, a statement of the capacity in which the plaintiff sues must be indorsed (i.e. disclosed) on the writ.

* Where a defendant is sued in a representative capacity, a statement of the capacity in which the defendant is being sued must also be indorsed on the writ.

_Akrong and Another v. Bulley (1965) GLR 469_:

>The plaintiff was the mother of a man negligently killed in June 1961 by a tipper truck owned by the second defendant and driven by the first defendant.  The plaintiff brought an action under the Fatal Accidents Acts, 1846-64. In her writ, she professed to sue as "successor and next-of-kin." The writ was issued in March 1962 and in November 1962, the plaintiff was granted leave to amend the title of her suit by prefixing to the words "successor and next-of-kin" the words "personal representative." The plaintiff did not, however, take out letters of administration till December 1962.  The trial judge found a case of negligence proved against the defendants.  To the defendants' argument that as at the time the action was commenced, the plaintiff had not taken out letters of administration, she did not disclose any legal capacity to sue, the trial judge's response was that the plaintiff herself was a "beneficiary" and therefore entitled to sue under the Fatal Accidents (Amendment) Act, 1864. 

* Before a writ is filed by a plaintiff who acts by an order or on behalf of a person resident outside Ghana, the writ shall be indorsed with a statement of that fact and with the address of the person so resident.

<u>**Indorsement as to plaintiff**</u>

* Where the plaintiff sues by a lawyer, the plaintiff shall provide at the back of the writ the lawyer’s firm name and business address in Ghana and also, if the lawyer is the agent of another, the firm name and business address of his principal.

* Where the plaintiff sues by a lawyer, the business address of the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s lawyer as indorsed on the writ shall be the address for service of the plaintiff.

* Where the plaintiff sues in person, the plaintiff’s address in the country as indorsed on the writ shall be the address for service of the plaintiff.

* By **Order 2 Rule 5(5)**, where the address of the defendant after diligent search is not known, the plaintiff shall indicate on the writ that the plaintiff shall direct service.

Writ and Statement of claim

* By **Order 2 Rule 6** every writ shall be filed together with a statement of claim as provided for in Order 11 (Pleadings), and no writ shall be issued unless a statement of claim is filed with it

<u>**Issue of writ**</u>

* A writ is deemed filed if it is accepted by the Registrar and sealed with the court’s stamp after payment of the appropriate filing fees.

* According to **Order 2 Rule 7**, leave of the court is required to issue a writ for a party outside the jurisdiction and leave to serve as well. A motion ex parte is used to seek this leave, the notice of the writ will be served when leave is granted not the writ itself; 

_Lokko v Lokko [1991] 2 GLR 184_ 

>The Plaintiff served notice of writ outside the jurisdiction without leave. The Defendant, who resided abroad, entered appearance without protest though her solicitors and submitted a statement of defence. The Trial court declared the writ null and void as leave was not sought. The Plaintiff appealed this ruling. 

>Held: - a writ of summons intended for service out of the jurisdiction, if issued without leave, would be a violation of the High Court rules. Such a fundamental error would result in the writ being declared null and void and it could not be saved by an Order on the non-compliance of rules. 

>If the defendant had a foreign address it was a strong indication, though not conclusive, that the writ of summons was intended for service out of the jurisdiction. Where there was evidence of lawyers within the jurisdiction ready to accept service of the writ and conduct litigation on behalf of the defendant, despite the foreign address, it was a clear indication that the writ was not the type intended for service outside the jurisdiction.

Contrast this decision with the case below:

_Friesland Frico Domo v Dachel Co Ltd [2012] 1 SCGLR 41_ 

>Someone was served outside the jurisdiction, he took steps and did not raise the objection that leave was not sought to serve. When it got to judgment he wanted to set aside the action but it was deemed to be too late.

<u>**Concurrent Writs   Order 2 Rule 8**</u>

* At the request of the plaintiff, one or more concurrent writs may be issued:

 * At the time when the original writ is issued

 * At any later time after the original writ is issued and
 * Before the original writ ceases to be valid

* A concurrent writ is a true copy of the original writ with such difference, if any, as are necessary having regard to the purpose for which the writ is issued. 

* A concurrent writ shall be sealed by being marked “concurrent” with an official stamp, and with the date on which it is issued. 

* A writ for service within the jurisdiction may be issued as a concurrent writ with another writ, notice of which is to be served out of the jurisdiction. The converse is also true; a writ, notice of which is to be served out of the jurisdiction can be issued as a concurrent writ with one which is to be served within the jurisdiction.

<u>**Duration and renewal of writ**</u>

* By **Order 2 Rule 9** a writ of summons shall be valid for service in the first instance for **12 months** beginning from the date of issue. It expires after this. It may be renewed before it expires but if expires, you cannot apply for a renewal. It can be renewed for a period not exceeding **12 months**. The application is done by an <span style="color:blue;"ex parte motion</span>. 

_Agbesi v Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority [2007-208] 2 SCGLR 469_

* A concurrent writ shall only be valid in the first instance for the period of he validity of the original writ and the original writ should not be expired at the time the concurrent writ is issued.

* If a renewal of a writ is applied for it must be supported by an affidavit showing all the circumstances relied on, including the date of issue of the original writ and if it has already been renewed, the date of the last renewal, and a full explanation as to why it has not already been served.

* Where a writ is renewed, the validity of all other writs, whether original or concurrent, issued in the same action which have not been served shall also be extended.
