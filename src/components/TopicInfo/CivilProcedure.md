### CIVIL PROCEDURE 2017 - 2018

##### What is Civil Procedure?

These are body of rules that are formulated to regulate the conduct of civil cases in court.

It provides for instance how an action can be commenced, steps that ought to be taken after the commencement of an action, methods of enforcing judgments/rulings of victorious parties, and how to appeal against such provisions.

Thus, civil proceedings could also be defined as proceedings initiated in court without the involvement of the police.

* Statutes creating the various courts – e.g. Courts Act 1993 (Act 459) and Courts (Amendment) Act 2002 (Act 620). These are the statutes that create the district court and the other lower courts.

* Rules of court – The Constitution provides for a Rules of Court Committee to make subsidiary legislation in the form of constitutional instruments that outline the practice and procedure to be used in the Courts. As stated above, the District Court is governed by C.I. 59, the High Court and Circuit Court are governed by C.I.47, the Court of Appeal is governed by C.I.19 and the Supreme Court is governed by C.I.16. 

* Case law from the superior courts which discuss and settle on the acceptable procedure to be used.


* Practice Directions – These are directions given by the superior courts which show and direct the way a particular rule of court should be complied with and observed. They are reported in the Law Reports in the same manner as cases are reported.
