### Joinder of Causes of Action and Joinder of Parties

**Order 4**

##### Joinder of Causes of Action

>Example: Company A orders 1000 barrels of Grade 2 Ethanol at GH¢59,000 from Company B. Company B sends its truck to deliver the goods which it does. In reversing out of Company A the truck runs into the vehicle of the managing director of Company A. Upon checking the barrels company A realises that only 800 barrels of Grade D ethanol were delivered. Company A writes to Company B to make good on the contract and they refuse. Company A wants to take them to court
Two causes of action: Negligence and Breach of Contract. Law allows them to join both causes of action, issuing one writ.

A plaintiff has the right to claim a relief against a defendant in respect of one or more causes of action in one action.

**Order 4 Rule 2** provides for three situations under which a plaintiff could join two or more causes of action in one writ.

1. A plaintiff can join several and different causes of action against the same defendant if the plaintiff claims or alleges that the defendant is liable in respect of all the causes of action endorsed on the writ. 

2. A plaintiff can also join on the same writ a cause of action against an executor or administrator or customary successor in his representative capacity with an action in his personal capacity provided both actions arise as a result of the same estate.

  * Example: A is the customary successor of the deceased person. In the cause of going about arranging the funeral etc. he runs B down. The deceased person also borrowed money from the very same B. B can sue for both the money and the injury using the same writ even though he is suing A in his personal capacity for the injury and suing A in his capacity as a successor for the debt from the deceased estate. However the injury damages will come from A personally whilst the debt will be taken from the estate.

3. If none of the two situations above is applicable, then the plaintiff must seek leave of the court through an ex parte application before the writ is issued. Example if a man and wife are involved in a commercial dispute about a family business and are also getting a divorce

The rationale behind this rule is that all disputes arising between the same parties should be tried and determined in one and the same action as much as practicable. This is to avoid multiplicity of suits. 

Note however that claims, such as damages for trespass, perpetual injunction are not different causes of actions but are ancillary reliefs and may be added to substantive claims, such as recovery of possession, without leave of the courts.

It is also important to know that joinder of causes of action is not the same as consolidation of suits (e.g. where there is an accident and 10 people are injured, instead of each issuing a separate writ against the car owner, one party can apply for the cases to be consolidated and tried by one judge as the facts are the same and the defendant is the same; separate independent suits brought together to be tried by one judge thus judgment is entered in each suit).

*Societe Generale Social Securtity Bank v Hajaara Farms Ltd [2012] 1 SCGLR 1* 
This case discusses how causes of action can concurrently be tried together. Read Justice Bataba’s decision.

###Joinder of Parties

This can be Original parties joining a stranger to an action or a stranger requesting to be joined to the action.

Generally, a person who wants to go to court must consider who is to be the plaintiff and who is to be the defendant(s). A plaintiff must show in his statement of claim that there is a cause of action in each and every plaintiff and a liability on the part of each person made a defendant to the action. If any of the plaintiffs is likely to put up a conflicting claim or case to that of the rest he should not be added as a plaintiff. 

If any person has a good ground for a counterclaim against any of the plaintiffs in the action this defendant should not be joined, because his counterclaim may embarrass the other plaintiffs or it may delay or prolong the trial.

Again if a person sought to be joined as a plaintiff is a man of straw he should not be added because where joint liability is decreed for costs or any financial obligation the indigent plaintiff cannot pay and execution will be levied against the other plaintiffs.

Generally, two or more persons may be joined in one suit as plaintiffs or defendants without leave of the court. 

This is where if separate actions were brought by or against each of them some common question of law or fact would rise in the action and again if the relief claimed in those actions whether jointly, severally or in the alternative relate to or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions. 

Examples are as follows:

1. Where a road is constructed through land owned by several people the owners of the land can bring one suit against the state for compensation 

2. Where several employees are dismissed, even if on different dates, but on the same grounds the several employees can institute one action against the employer.

3. Where persons are injured by the negligence of two drivers, the persons injured may bring one action against the drivers and the car owners and it is not necessary for the two cases to be identical before joinder. For example in an accident passengers may suffer different degree of injuries but the action can be joined. What is important is that there is a common question of law or facts to be determined by the court.

Under **Order 4 Rule 3**, where a plaintiff in an action (other than a probate action) claims any relief which any other person is entitled jointly with the plaintiff all such persons so entitled shall be joined to action and any person who does not consent to being joined as a plaintiff shall be made a defendant. 

<span syle="color:green;">**Reluctant Parties Rule**</span>. The rationale is that the court wants to hear all parties concerned in the dispute. By making him a defendant, the reluctant party is compelled to come to court to be heard and the court can ascertain for itself the reason for his reluctance. Plus any judgment that will be issued will be binding on him too.

###Joinder of joint defendants

Where an action is against a defendant who is jointly liable with another person, that other person need not be made a defendant to the action. The third party is bound by the judgment

Where two or more persons are joined as defendants it is not a requirement that every defendant should be interested in all the reliefs claimed in the writ or as to every cause of action included in the writ. E.g. Kofi v A, B, C, D where Kofi is claiming money from A, return of car from B and specific performance from C and D. Example A sells B’s land wrongfully to C. B may sue A and C together, claiming against A declaration of title to the land and against C recovery of possession and perpetual injunction.

*Conca Engineering v Moses*

It is important to note that where the defendants are sued severally and not jointly, judgment against one of such defendants does not operate as a bar to the action against the others. 

If two or more persons have coterminous interests in a property (interest that rely on each other) it is not necessary to join all as defendants. A judgment against one will bind others whose interests are coterminous. Example a judgment against a grantee will bind the grantor, and a judgment against a purchaser will bind the vendor, a judgment against a paramount chief concerning stool property will bind a sub-chief and a judgment against head of family concerning family land will bind a member/elder of the family, a judgment against a principal will bind an agent of the principle.

*Nkum v Andoh [1959] GLR 358*

>Kojo Ando was in possession of certain land in the village of Abura in the Ogua State; he said that it had been in the possession of his family for some 80 years. Kojo Nkum laid claim to this land, saying that the virgin forest of all that area had been cleared by his ancestors. Nkum admitted that the disputed land had been in Andoh’s possession for 15 years without action being taken by Nkum’s family. Nkum as head of the family issued proceedings in Cape Coast Municipal Court claiming recovery of possession. That Court found that Nkum had not proved his title. Nkum appealed to the Land Court. 

>Held: that the evidence amply justified the trial court’s finding; that in any even the plaintiff was estopped by acquiescence of conduct, in that the defendant’s family has been allowed to obtain adverse possession, and (on plaintiff’s admission) to retain it for 15 years; the plaintiff was further estopped per rem judicatem by reason of the judgment (adverse to his title) in which a relative of the present plaintiff had unsuccessfully litigated the land as against the present defendant.

###Outcome of joinder of cause of action or joinder of parties

Whenever the courts grant an application for joinder of cause of action or joinder of parties and it appears to the court that a joinder of the cause of action or parties will embarrass or delay the trial or it will inconvenience the proceedings the court may do any of the following:

a. Order separate trials;

b. Confine the action to some of the causes of action and exclude others;

c. Order the plaintiff(s) to elect which cause of action should be proceeded with;

d. Regarding parties, order which plaintiffs shall remain or shall cease to be plaintiffs in the case;

e. Order a defendant to be struck out so as not to embarrass the defendant or cause the defendant any expense by being required to attend proceedings in which a defendant has no interest;

f. Make such order as the justice of the matter may deem fit.

###Misjoinder and Non-Joinder

Misjoinder – when you’ve wrongly joined someone to the case

Non Joinder- you’ve not joined someone who should have been joined

No proceedings or matter shall be defeated by reason only of misjoinder or non-joinder of any party. The court is empowered to determine the issues in dispute in an action so far as they affect the rights and interest of the persons who are parties to the action. The court may at any stage of the proceedings, either on its own motion suo motu, or on application by a party, do any of the following:

a. Order any person who has been improperly been made a party or who for any reason is no longer a party or a necessary party, to cease to be a party i.e. strike them out;

b. the court may order any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the court is necessary to ensure all matters in dispute in the proceedings are effectively and completely determined and adjudicated upon to be added as a party.

*Jonah v Duodu Kumi [2003-2004] SCGLR 50*

No person however shall be added as a plaintiff without that person’s consent signified in writing or in such other manner as may be authorised by the court e.g. through a court order made subsequent to that person applying to be joined as a plaintiff.

The rationale for misjoinder and non-joinder and joinders in general is to avoid multiplicity of actions and to ensure that disputes are effectively and completely resolved among the disputants 

###Test to be applied

Test that we apply as to whether a person should be joined or not to an action was stated by Lord Denning in *Gurtner v Circuit (1968) 2 QB 587* 

>When two parties are in dispute in an action at law and the determination of that dispute will directly affect a third person in his legal rights or in his pocket, in that he will be bound to foot the bill, then the court in its discretion may allow him to be added as a party on such terms as it deems fit. 

By so doing the court achieves the object of the rule and it enables all matters in dispute to be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon between all those directly concerned in the outcome. 

The courts generally have the jurisdiction to join a party whose presence is necessary for the determination of the issues in the dispute. The court does not need the plaintiff’s consent to add a party. However, if a prospective plaintiff refuses to be added, the court will simply add them as a defendant.

###Mode of Application for joinder

Any application by any person for an order to add that person as a party shall be made by motion on notice supported by an affidavit showing the person’s interest in the matter in dispute at the trial. 

If the application is by a person already a party the motion shall be on notice to the person sought to be joined and the affidavit must show the interest of the person sought to be joined.

Cardinal test is that the person must have an interest which is shown in the affidavit

###Pursuant Orders

When an order is made as regards joinder and non-joinder of parties the writ shall within 14 days after the making of the order or such period to be specified in the order be amended by the plaintiff and endorsed with the reference to the order and the date on which the order to the amendment was made. 

No matter who joins the party, whether it was on the side of the defendant or not, it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to amend the writ. If he does not do it within 14 days, the order lapses.

Where a person is ordered to be made a defendant, the person on whose application the order is made, shall procure it to be noted in the Cause Book by the Registrar and after that the amended writ shall be served on the person ordered to be made a defendant. A defendant so served shall thereafter file an appearance. 

A person ordered to be added as a party shall not become a party until the writ is amended in relation to the person and if the person is a defendant the writ has been served on him. 

This means that if by the time the amended writ is served on the new defendant the action is statute barred. The defendant can raise that fact as an automatic defence not withstanding the fact that at the date the original writ was issued the action was not statute barred.
