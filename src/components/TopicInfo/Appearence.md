##Appearance
**Order 9**

When a writ is served on a defendant, every defendant is entitled to enter an appearance either by himself or through a lawyer. 

A defendant enters an appearance by filing a notice of appearance in triplicate (for the plaintiff, for the court and for defendant). 

Each defendant must file their own triplicate unless they are acting through the same lawyer. Then only one set of notices in triplicate need to be completed and delivered for those defendants.

The notice of appearance must disclose the defendant’s occupational and residential address, not withstanding the fact that this address has been stated on the writ of summons.

If the defendant does not provide this address then the plaintiff can apply for the court to order him to provide it. If he does not, it will be taken that appearance has not been entered and a judgment may be taken against him.

<u>Content of notice</u>

* Name of the court
* Suit number
* Name of the parties
* Defendant’s place of residence in the country and occupational address or, if the defendant has no place of residence, the address of a place in this country at or to which documents for him may be delivered of went
* Where the defendant appears by a lawyer, the business address of the lawyer in this country

The notice should be dated on the day on which it is handed in at or sent by post to the Registry, and shall be signed by the defendant if he appears in person or by the lawyer of the defendant.

The plaintiff’s address should also be on it.

Time limit for appearance is <span style="color:red;">**8 days** after service of the writ of summons<span>, or where the time is extended by the court then within the extended time e.g. if the notice of writ is to be served out of the jurisdiction. 

The 8 days is determined by **Order 80 1 (5)**: Where, apart from this rule, the period in question is a period of seven days or less and would include a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday, that day shall be excluded. So 8 days will include public holidays and weekends.

Under CI 47 a defendant cannot enter appearance when a judgment has been entered against him unless he have leave of the court. **Order 9 Rule 6(2)**

If a defendant files appearance after 8 days, he is precluded (unless the Court otherwise orders) from serving a defence or any there process later than if he had appeared within time i.e. the defendant gets no extra time. If he enters appearance late and only has 3 days left to serve his defence he must serve his defence within those three days. Order 9 Rule 6(2)

There are two types of appearance: 
* Conditional   **Order 9 Rule 7**
* Unconditional

Unconditional appearance is where the defendant does not raise any objections to the issuance or service of the writ.

The defendant will enter a conditional appearance where they do have objections to the issuance or service of the writ (aka appearance under protest). 

Four grounds on which conditional appearance can be entered **Order 9 Rule 8**:
1. Where they have objections to the issuance of the writ;
2. Where they have objections to the service of the writ;
3. Where the defendant claims the writ or notice of the writ has not ben served
4. Where the defendant objects to any order that gives leave to serve notice of the writ on the defendant outside the jurisdiction.

Why a writ may be defective:
* If leave of the court was not sought before the writ was issued and the rules require leave be obtained first.
* If the court in which the action has been commenced has no jurisdiction
* If the plaintiff is not vested with a cause or action
* If the writ is not accompanied by a statement of claim
* Where a statutory notice, which is a condition precedent was not obtained
* If the service of the writ or service of the notice of a writ is irregular because it was not done according to the rules.

*Amissah-Abadoo v Abaddoo [1973] 1 GLR 490*

*Mosi v Bagyina [1963] 1 GLR 337*

*Ghana Muslims Representative Council v Salifu [1975] 2 GLR 246* (Cause of Action)

The fact that the defendant is entering a conditional appearance must be obvious from the title of the document (Form 5) i.e.  Notice of Entry of Conditional Appearance.

The defendant can at anytime before filing appearance move the court to set aside a writ for irregularity/being defective. 

However, if the defendant enters a conditional appearance then he has <span style="color:red;">**14 days**<span> to move the court to either set aside the writ or set aside the service of the writ or to discharge any order that gives leave to serve the notice of the defendant outside the country. This effectively freezes the proceedings for 14 days. **Order 9 Rule 8**

If he does not file a motion to set aside within the 14 days the appearance becomes unconditional. **Order 9 Rule 7**

Note that service of a writ on a person is irregular if the defendant is fraudulently induced to come within the jurisdiction for the sole purpose of serving him with the writ.

###Judgment in Default of Appearance
**Order 10**

Generally, if a defendant fails to make an appearance within the 8 day time limit, the plaintiff has the right to move the court, on an <span style="color:blue;">**ex parte**</span> application, for judgment. 

The nature of judgment that the court will award, depends on the  cause or action. 

1.For a **liquidated demand or claim** the plaintiff can apply for final judgment against the defendant. **Order 10 Rule 1**

2. If it is an **unliquidated demand or claim** then the plaintiff can take an interlocutory judgment (judgment posed pending the final resolution of the case as opposed to interim judgment which is for a set short period of time e.g. 10 days) as opposed to a final judgment. After the interlocutory judgment a date must be set to assess damages. The defendant who has not entered appearance must be notified of the date for damages to be assessed. **Order 10 Rule 2**

      a. An unliquidated claim is a claim for which a specific value cannot be calculated mathematically. In other words, in an unliquidated claim the amount and liability will not be precisely determined or that it cannot be determined without an evidentiary hearing. For instance, in the case of a car accident, the pain suffered is a question to be determined by the jury and hence any claim with respect to the pain suffered is an unliquidated claim.

3. Claim in Detinue (i.e. recovery of goods or their value)

	a.Default judgment may entered for the delivery of the goods or their value to be assessed and costs; or for the value of the goods to be assessed and costs.

	b. Where the defendant is served to appear for the assessment of the value and the damages he will be heard on the issue of damages only because judgment has already been entered for the defendant to deliver the goods or to give the value of the goods. **Order 10 Rule 3**

4. Claims for action of Possession of Immovable Property

	a. The plaintiff shall apply for judgment of possession of the immovable property and costs against the defendant.

	b. If defendants have been sued jointly, then if default judgment is entered against a defendant who fails to enter appearance that judgment CANNOT be enforced until judgment for possession of the immovable property has been obtained against all the other defendants. If they are sued jointly and severally then they can recover against the one who did not appear.

	c. If there are multiple defendants and some enter appearance whilst some do not, those who have not entered appearance can have default judgments taken against them in the manner described above. However the plaintiff must continue the claim against the other defendants on its merits. **Order 10 Rule 4**

5. Mixed claims

	a. So the subject of the claims is mixed e.g. a liquidated claim and detinue, the plaintiff may enter such judgment against a defendant in respect of any such claim as the rules entitle him to enter. Take each claim separately and obtain the type of judgment required for each type of claim e.g. interlocutory judgment for liquidated claim and date fixed for damages to be assessed and judgment for possession in claim for immovable property **Order 10 Rule 5**

6. Actions not specifically provided for

	a. In actions where the rules do not specifically provide the nature of judgment to be entered, the plaintiff, after filing an affidavit proving due service of the writ of summons (i.e. that he has indeed been served) and statement of claim on the defendant, proceed with the action as if the defendant had filed appearance.  E.g whenever a plaintiff endorses his writ of declaration of title/ it is a matrimonial suit (divorce)/probate actions a default judgment cannot be entered so a court date has to be set. Order 10 Rule 6**

Judgment in default of appearance will never be entered unless the plaintiff files an affidavit proving due service of the writ of summons or notice of a writ on the defendant. **Order 10 Rule 7**

There are certain specific actions where default judgment cannot be taken:

1. Money lenders actions: In an action brought by a moneylender or an assignee for the recovery of money lent by the moneylender or for the enforcement of any agreement or security relating to any such money, default judgment can only be taken with the leave of the court and the leave must be on notice to the defendant. The notice should not be less than 3 clear days before the hearing date.

2. Mortgage actions: No default judgment can be entered except with the leave of the court. This is because usually there are third party interests to be considered. The Court may require the application for leave to be supported by evidence which entitles the applicant to relief and may direct that notice of the application shall be given to the defendant and to such other person as the Court may consider proper. **Order 10 Rule 10 / Order 59 Rule 5**

### Setting aside judgment in default of appearance

The Court may set aside or vary any judgment entered by default on such terms as it deems fit.

Every application to set aside must be supported by an affidavit.

The Court’s power to set aside default judgment is inherent and discretionary, so the party applying to set aside the judgments must show through his affidavit that:

1. He has a reasonable defence to the action
2. He has good reasons why he failed to enter appearance.

There is no time limit to set aside a default judgment however it must be done within a reasonable time. 

What is reasonable depends on the circumstances of each case.
