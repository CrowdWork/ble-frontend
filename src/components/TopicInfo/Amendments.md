### Amendments

**Order 16**

Parties, as noted, are bound by their pleadings and for that matter cannot give evidence on any fact not alleged in the pleading. In drawing the pleadings, a party may make errors or the facts pleaded may turn out not to be material while the material facts have been left out. To prevent injustice and to enable the court to determine all matters in controversy, the courts are empowered to grant a party a right to amend their pleadings with or without leave. 

The power of the court to grant amendments is discretionary but must be exercised judiciously. The important question that the court needs to answer is whether or not the amendment will promote the cause of justice as between the parties or that it is necessary for the purpose of determining the material issues in dispute. 

The court’s source of power to grant amendments from **Order 16** of CI 47 and **Order 81 Rule 1(2)(b)** which allows an amendment where there is non-compliance with the rules in certain circumstances. Again **Order 4** also allows the court to grant the amendment by joining parties or causes of actions. 

Generally, the courts will allow an amendment unless

1. It will entail injustice to the other party or

2. The application is made mala fide or 

3. If by the blunder committed the other party has suffered some injury which cannot be compensated with costs

*Cropper v Smith [1884] 26 Chancery Division 700*


<u>When can an amendment be made?</u>

At any stage of the proceedings.

In *Adjeley v Sowa and Another [1966] GLR 754-757* it was held: 

> Where it appeared that the way a party had framed his case would not lead to a decision on the real matter in controversy it was a matter of right on his part to have it corrected if it could be done without injustice to the other party. However negligent or careless a party might have been and however late the proposed amendment, it ought to be granted if it was made bona fide and caused no injustice to the other party or the other party could be compensated by costs or otherwise.


The timing of amendments was extensively discussed in *Yeboa v Bofour [1971] 2 GLR 199, CA* where it was said that the court will allow an amendment even up to the last moment, provided that

1. No surprise results;

2. It does not enable a party to set up an entirely new case or to change completely the nature of his case; *Nkrumah v Serwah [1984]-86] 1 GLR 190, CA*; *Robertson v Reindorf [1971] 2 GLR 289, CA*

3. It is not sought to add new parties;

4. It will not do any injury to the opponent’s case or prejudice him in some way which cannot be compensated by costs or otherwise;

5. The application be made bona fide; *Deegbe v Nsiah [1984-86] 1 GLR 590*, CA; *Lartey & Lartey v Beany [1987-88] 1 GLR 590*

6. The proposed amendment will not cause undue delay or is irrelevant or useless or would merely raise a technical point; *Gandaa v Gandaa [1989-90] 2 GLR 58*

If leave is required, the court in considering how to use its discretion can take into account how late in the proceedings the amendment has been brought. Amendments can be granted very late in proceedings, for example in Yeboa an application was made for amendment after the judgment had been delivered but before being signed yet it was still granted. 

Despite this, in exercising their discretion the courts must keep in mind the following (Kwame Tetteh at 458):

(a)	the strain of litigation the amendment may impose on the adversary, 

(b)	the impact of the amendment on the legitimate expectations of the adversary, 

(c)	the efficient conduct of the case in question, and 

(d)	the interest of other litigants whose cases are waiting to be heard, if the application for amendment succeeds. 

Furthermore, amendments should not be used to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different defence *Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd [1988] 1 All ER 38*

The purpose of an amendment as indicated above is to enable the courts to determine the real question or issues in controversy between the parties and also to correct any error or defects in the proceedings.

*Tildesley v Haper [1876] 10 Chancery Division 393*: 

>Where Lord Justice Bramwell stated as follows ‘ My practice has always been to give leave to amend unless I have been satisfied that the party applying was acting mala fide and that by his blunder he had done some injury to his opponent which could not be compensated for by costs or otherwise’.

The principle adopted by the courts is that amendment must be allowed, however late, if it can be made without causing injustice to the other side. There is no injustice caused if the other side can be compensated by costs. 

Amendment may be without leave or with the leave of the court depending on the stage of the proceedings.

<u> What is the test for allowing an amendment under the Rules?</u>

This was explained in Yeboa v Bofour above.

The position in Yeboa was subsequently adopted in *In re Ashalley Botwe Lands; Adjetey Agbosu and Others v Kotey and Others [2003-2004] SCGLR 420-470*

The case also explained that just because an amendment is unopposed does not mean it should be automatically granted.

Facts: the application for amendment was unopposed and the trial court granted but the Court of Appeal reversed the grant. The Supreme Court set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal. Georgina Wood JSC enumerated the grounds of opposition, which the respondent to an application for amendment must raise, failing which the court must presume that the respondent would not suffer the prejudice subsumed.
 
Per Georgina Wood JSC: 

> Upon the application for leave to amend, the defendants themselves , who were the persons to be directly affected by the order sought, expressly stated that they were not opposed to the grant. As a general rule, such open declarations should not entitle an applicant to an automatic grant; but it is equally true that in civil trials in particular, the grant or refusal of leave is largely influenced by the objection(s) raised. Certainly, it is the defendant who stands in a good position to bring to the court’s immediate attention the injury or harm he/she was most likely to suffer by the grant and which harm was incapable of redress by way of costs. True, the courts are in an equally good position to assess other critical factors like whether or not the proposed amendment would cause undue delay or was irrelevant. But such matters as that the proposed amendment would result in a surprise, injustice or prejudice; or that it would jeopardize the respondent’s case or even more importantly, that it would enable the applicant to set up an entirely new case or completely change the nature of his/her case, in the normal run of things, should be raised by the opponent, if, indeed, such were the case. Again, in such matters, the stage at which the application is brought has very little to do with the decision, for under [the Rules] the application may be brought at any stage of the proceedings. 
Again, in such matters, the stage at which the application is brought has very little to do with the decision…

Per Brobbey JSC at 460: 

>The established rule therefore is that amendment can be made at any stage of the proceedings. 

*Konadu v Ntoah [1971] 1 GLR 318*: a High Court decision approved and applied in *Agbesi v Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority [2007-2008] SCGLR 469* where it was stated: An amendment in violation of the Rules may be declared void.

For the most part the court tends to grant amendments if the mistake which is to be corrected is not fraudulent or intended to overreach and it would not cause injustice to the other party. The Courts role is not to discipline the parties but to fairly decide the matters between the parties.

Applied in: 

*Yeboa v Bofour [1971] 2 GLR 199, CA*
*Hausa v Hausa [1972] 2 GLR 469, CA*
*Adjeley v Sowa [1966] GLR 754*


<u>Amendment of writ without leave</u>

**Order 16 Rule 1**

The plaintiff may amend the writ **once** without leave at any time before the close of pleadings [7 days after a reply is served] and where a writ is amended without leave the amended writ shall be served on each defendant to the action. 

*Hasnem v ECG [1992] 2 GLR 250*

<u>Amendment of notice of Appearance</u>

*Order 16 Rule 2*

A defendant shall not amend the notice of appearance without leave of the court. 

Leave may be granted if justice so requires. Since the rules do not permit the withdrawal of appearance once it has been entered, an amendment is the only way to change the status of appearance.

The old rule that a defendant can only amend notice of appearance when no further step has been taken, as enunciated in *Esson v Oppan [1992] 2 GLR 36* no longer applies. Even if a step has been taken, appearance can still be amended.

<u>Amendment of pleadings without leave</u> 

*Order 16 Rule 3*

A party can amend any pleading without leave of the court once, at any time before pleadings are closed. Where a party amends a pleading without leave the amended pleading must be served on all the parties on the other side. 

Where an amended statement of claim is served on a defendant the defendant may amend his statement of defence filed without leave of the court to respond directly to the plaintiff’s amendment.

The period for the service of the defence or amended defence shall be either the period fixed by the rules for service of defence or a period of **14 days** after the amended statement of claim is served on the defendant, whichever expires later. 

Where an amended statement of defence is served on the plaintiff, the plaintiff may amend the reply if any is filed without leave of the court to respond directly to the defendant’s amendment. 

Three circumstances in which amendments can make without leave

1. Where pleadings have not closed

2. Where plaintiff is responding to amended statement of defence

3. Where the defendant is responding to an amended Statement of Claim

The period for service of the reply or amended reply shall be     **14 days** after the amended defence is served on the plaintiff. Note that references to defence and reply in sub rules 2 and 3 of Order 16 Rule 3, include references to a counterclaim and a defence to a counterclaim respectively (as these are also pleadings that can be amended).

Note that by **Order 16 Rule 3(6)**, the effect of not responding to an amended pleading is that the defaulting party will be deemed to rely on the unamended pleading in answer to the amended pleading because the amended pleading takes effect from the date the original pleading is filed.

<u>Application to strike out an amendment without leave</u>

A party has <span style="colour:red;">within **14 days** after service on him of an amended pleading without leave</span> to apply to the court to strike out the amendment. Where the court, hearing such an application, is satisfied that the amendment would not have been granted if leave was sought the court shall order the amendment or that part to be struck out. (ie the question for the  court is whether that amendment would have been allowed if notice had been sought).

<u>Amendment of a writ or a pleading with leave</u>

The court may at any stage of the proceedings before judgment, upon an application by a plaintiff or any other party grant leave to 

1. The plaintiff to amend a writ of summons or for a defendant who has a counterclaim to amend the counterclaim;
2. Any party to amend the party’s pleading on terms as may be just and in a manner as may be directed by the court.

<u>Amending misnomer</u>

**Order 16 Rule 5(3)**

**Order 16 Rule 5(3)** allows the courts to amend petty errors in pleadings or in a writ. For example, the name of a party can be corrected through amendment. The amendment to correct the name of a party may be allowed, notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment would be to substitute a new party, if the court is satisfied that the mistake sought to be corrected was genuine and was not misleading or to cause any reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intending to sue or be sued. 

*Mussey v Darko [1977] 1 GLR 147-155*

>This was a case where a sole proprietorship (which is a non juristic person meaning it cannot sue or be sued) issued a writ mistakenly in his name and later gave an explanation which was reasonable for his mistake, the court could treat the mistake as a mere misnomer and grant an application for leave to amend the title. In this case the amendment was sought for and granted after judgment, because the court wanted to do justice in the matter rather than striking out the whole case. 

A similar decision was reached in *Dove v Wuta-Ofei [1966] GLR 299-318* where the Supreme Court amended the title of the suit.

Contrast this with the case of *Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation v Vicenta Publication [1971] 2 GLR 24*

>Here the court refused to amend the title because neither the appellant or his lawyer was prepared to disclose the proprietor or proprietress of the firm and counsel was also not sure whether the firm was registered under the Registration of Business Names Act 1962, Act 151. 

Note, however, that naming a non-juristic person as a party may not always be considered to be a misnomer. If a non-juristic person is expressed as a plaintiff the action may be struck out. There can’t be a valid amendment to the suit because there was no legal person as a plaintiff to bring the action.

Under **Order 16 Rule 5(4)** an amendment may be allowed to alter the capacity in which a party sues if the new capacity is one which that party had at the date of the commencement of the proceedings or has since acquired. If this rule had come into force earlier the case of *Akrong v Bulley [1965] GLR 469-478* would have been wrong.

**Order 15 Rule 5(5)** says an amendment may be allowed to add or substitute a new cause or action if the new cause or action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to amend. 

<u>Amending other documents</u>
 
For purposes of determining the real issues in controversy between the parties or correcting any defects or error in the proceedings, the court may at any stage of the proceedings either of its own motion or on application by a party order any document in the proceedings to be amended on terms as may be just. Amendments are easily granted when the grant does not necessitate the calling of additional evidence. 

###Failure to amend after order

Where the court makes an order giving a party leave to amend a writ, pleading or other document then if that party does not effect the amendment in accordance with the order of the court before the expiration of the period specified, or if no period is specified then 14 days after the order is made, then that order shall cease to have effect without prejudice to the power of the court to extend the period. 
*Mahama Hausa and Others v Baako Hausa and Another (1972) 2 GLR 469*
*Kwantreng II and Others v Klu (1991) 2 GLR 93* 
*Akufo-Addo v Catheline (1992) 1 GLR 377*

<u>Effect of Amendment</u>

An amended writ or pleading relates back to the date the writ or pleading amended was filed. For example, an amended writ becomes the origin of the action and the reliefs claimed therein are substituted for those on the original writ. Commencement date is different from amendment date. 
*Kai v Amarkye [1982-83] GLR 817*

<u>Method of applying for leave to amend</u>

An application for leave to amend a writ or a pleading shall be on notice to all the parties in the action. The application shall specify precisely the nature of the amendment intended to be made. An affidavit may be used in an application for leave to amend.

<u>Stage of proceedings for applying amendment</u>

The general rule is that amendment can be applied for and granted at any stage of the proceedings. In practice however, it is not so simple. The courts apply different considerations in granting or refusing the amendment. For example, is the amendment before or after close of evidence or close of case? In practice, amendments after close of case are generally refused unless there is evidence on record to support the amendment. If the amendment will demand the calling of fresh evidence after close of case, it will be refused though such amendment may be granted depending on the circumstance of each case. 

<u>Amendments not generally allowed in practice</u>

Immaterial amendments are not generally allowed because the purpose of amendment is to enable the real issues to be determined. Amending to withdraw an admission is not generally allowed, because an admission is a concession by a party of an assertion by the other party. Unless it was made inadvertently, the court will refuse it. Again generally, an amendment that seeks to set up a claim that is statute barred will not be allowed because if a writ cannot be issued for that claim then an amendment will not do. 

<u>Amendment of Judgment or Orders</u>

*Order 16 Rule 10*

This is known as <span style="color:green;">the Slip Rule</span>. Where clerical mistakes occur in certified judgments or orders of the court, or errors arising from accidental slips or omission occur, they may be corrected at anytime by the court either on its own motion (suo moto) on notice to the parties or on an application by the parties without an appeal.

*Republic v Mensah Bonsu and Another [1994-95] GBR 131 – a.k.a the "pg 78 case". Wrongly attributed quote to Dr Busia. It was stated by the judge that the truth is not a defence to contempt.

*Republic v Chieftaincy Committee on Wiamoasehene Stool Affairs Ex Parte Oppong Kwame [1978] GLR 467*

*Shirlstar Container Transport  Ltd v Ashanti Goldfields Corporation [1962] 1 GLR 566*

*Omaboe v Kwame (1978) GLR 112*

<u>Form of the amendment</u>

Any amendment authorised by the court may be made in a writ, pleading or other document by making the necessary alterations to the document by handwriting and in the case of a writ causing it to be re-sealed and filing a copy of it (usually type on top or writ form ‘Amended Writ Pursuant of Order dated x/x/2018’ if done with leave). 

Where the authorised amendments are so numerous or of such nature or length that to make written alterations will be difficult or inconvenient to read then a fresh document amended as authorised shall be prepared and filed and in the case of writ reissued. 

A writ, pleading or other document which has been amended shall be endorsed with a statement that it has been so amended, specifying:

a.	the date on which it was amended, 
b.	the name of the judge who made the order authorising the amendment and 
c.	the date of the order. 

If no such order was made (i.e. amendment without leave) then the number of the Rule in C.I.47 under which the amendment was made should be quoted.
