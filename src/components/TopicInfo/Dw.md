##Discontinuance/Withdrawal 

*Order 17*

You can discontinue with leave or without leave.

The rules provide that you can discontinue without leave so long as you do not take any step after defence has been served. It is always the plaintiff that discontinues/withdraws as they are the ones that initiate the action. Defendants with a counterclaim can also discontinue in respect of the counterclaim.

A plaintiff to an action or a defendant with a counterclaim has the right to withdraw or discontinue the action. The court cannot compel the parties to litigate. 

A plaintiff or a defendant with a counterclaim, may discontinue if he realises that the case will not succeed. The plaintiff may also discontinue to enable the parties to settle the case amicably. 

Discontinuance of an action by the plaintiff terminates the courtâ€™s power over the case. *Odompre v Aryeetey [1975] 1 GLR 297*

A party who has filed an appearance may withdraw the appearance at any time, but with the leave of the court.

<u>Discontinuance without leave</u>

By **Order 17 Rule 2(1)** except in the case of an interlocutory application, a plaintiff may discontinue an action without leave against all or any of the defendants by filing a notice of discontinuance to withdraw any part of the claim at any time before or after being served with the defendant statement of defence provided the plaintiff does not take any other step in the action for example, by filing a reply to the statement of defence or filing an amended statement of claim. 

Upon withdrawal or discontinuance the plaintiff will be ordered to pay costs and the discontinuance or withdrawal shall not be raised subsequently as an estoppel against bringing the case to court again. Depending on the circumstances the plaintiff is allowed to bring a fresh case. 

<u>Discontinuance with leave</u>

When a plaintiff has taken a step after a defence has been served on him that plaintiff may not withdraw or discontinue the action without leave of the court. 

The court may upon application before, during or after the hearing of the case order an action to be discontinued or any part of the cause or action to be struck out. Leave is normally granted subject to such terms as costs or as to any other action. 

The application for leave to discontinue is by <span style="color:blue;">**motion on notice**</span> supported by an affidavit and in granting the application the court may order the action to be discontinued or strike out any cause of action as prayed/sought by the applicant. 

The court may impose conditions for the grant of leave to discontinue. Such conditions could include barring further litigation on the matter by the plaintiff. 
*Amoako v Kwan [1975] 1 GLR 225* 
The court may also grant the leave with liberty to the plaintiff to relitigate the same case. 

In practice, where the court grants application for leave to discontinue without expressly granting the plaintiff the liberty to relitigate, i.e. where leave is granted simpliciter to discontinue, it has been held that the plaintiff in that circumstance cannot relitigate. This is because if you do not expressly request for discontinuance with liberty to relitigate, it is assumed you do not want to come back to court. Applying for discontinuance with leave gives the other side a chance to oppose your application. 

*Ibe v Pan African Metals Ltd [1967] GLR 188*

The court may refuse a plaintiff leave to relitigate if the action is frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the court process or if there is a strong defence to the action e.g. estoppel or the fact that the action is statute barred. In such cases a grant of liberty relitigate will serve not useful purpose. 
*Afeke v Agble [1987-88] 2 GLR 572*

<u>Withdrawal by consent</u>  
*Order 17 Rule 3*

Parties in an action may by consent agree to withdraw by filing a written consent to withdraw. Take note that when costs are awarded after discontinuance, that order is a final order and must be paid even if the plaintiff was granted liberty to relitigate or else the fresh action will be stayed.
