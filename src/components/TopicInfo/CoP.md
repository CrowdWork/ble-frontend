### Change of Parties by reason of death or bankruptcy

**Order 4 Rule 6**

Where a party dies or becomes bankrupt and the cause of action survives, the action shall not abate (discontinue or cease) because of the death or bankruptcy of the person. The personal representative of the deceased may apply to be substituted. 

Where a cause of action survives, upon the death of a sole plaintiff, his executor or administrator may obtain an order to carry on the proceedings. 

If one of several plaintiffs dies, the surviving plaintiffs may, if the cause of action is  jointly, continue the action without adding the personal representatives of the deceased plaintiff. 

If the cause of action is not joint, the personal representative of the deceased may obtain an order to carry on the proceedings. – If for instance there are about three plaintiffs and they sue jointly and one of them dies, because this is a joint action, there is no need to substitute the deceased. However, where the cause of action is jointly and severally, then the personal representatives of the deceased have to apply for substitution – that is, it is important that the personal representatives substitute the deceased and become party to the claim.

Where a cause of action survives, upon the death of a sole D, the P may obtain an order to continue the proceedings against the executor or administrator, or the executor or administrator may himself apply to be substituted or added as a D. But unless and until the executor or administrator is added, the action cannot continue. 

Upon the death of one of several Ds, if the Ds are jointly liable, the liability continues in the survivors.

If all the Defendants die, the proceedings should be continued against the representative of the last surviving D. 

If the Defendants are jointly and severally liable, the action on the death of one D be continued against the survivors or the personal representative of one of the deceased and the survivors. – that is, you can enforce the judgment against any one of them. Under joint and several liability of all sums, a claimant may pursue an obligation against any one party as if they were jointly liable and it becomes the responsibility of the defendants to sort out their respective proportions of liability and payment. 

To substitute the deceased, you can bring in the administrator, executive or customary successor of the deceased in order to attach the estate of the deceased. 


The application for substitution is made <span style="color:red;">**ex parte**</span> (through an ex parte motion) supported by an affidavit showing the following:

1. The nature and stage of the action.
2. The change that has occurred – if for instance someone is dead.
3. The interest or liability of the party against whom it is proposed to carry on the proceedings. 
4. The fact that the cause of action survives or continues. 


In the case of death, it must be proved strictly by exhibiting the death certificate. Note however, whenever adding a new Plaintiff , his consent in writing should be produced and verified – **Order 4 Rule 5(3)**

When a person obtains an order under the rules for substitution, the order shall be served on every other party in the proceedings. And where a person becomes a defendant as a result of an order to carry on he must be served also with a writ and the original processes filed in the proceedings/action. 

###Effect of order of substitution

A person ordered to be substituted as a party shall not become a party until the order is served on the person. 

Where the person becomes a party, all things done in the proceedings before the making of the order or substitution shall have effect as they had with the old party.

A person ordered to be a defendant or a newly added defendant, shall file appearance and the time limited for filing appearance shall begin from the date of service of the order on him. 

###Failure to proceed after death   
**Order 4 Rule 7**

Where the cause of action survives and the Plaintiff dies but no order is made to substitute the plaintiff with any person in whom the cause of action vests, the defendant may apply to the court for the action to be struck out. (motion on notice)

The court shall not make an order striking out the case unless it is satisfied that due notice of the application has been given to the personal representatives or customary successor or head of family of the deceased plaintiff. 

A person served with an order of substitution obtained ex parte may apply to the court within **14 days** to discharge or vary the order –for instance, if you think you are not the right party to be substituted, you need to move the court within 14 days to let the court know.
