##Applications 

**Order 19**  

Applications are made generally in the cause or pending proceedings so there must be proceedings pending in court in order for such an application to be made. Such applications are commonly called interlocutory applications and they follow events in the proceedings and an aggrieved party is entitled to apply for an order by an interlocutory application as a result of an event.

Applications are made to a judge sitting in open court or a judge in chambers. Generally contentious applications are heard in open court and non-contentious applications are heard in chambers since the hearing will not admit arguments (since its non contentious). 

Under Order 19 there are two types of motions:

1. Interlocutory motions **Order 19 Rule 1 (1)**

2. Originating motions or originating notice of motion **Order 19 Rule 1 (2)**

Interlocutory motions are made during the pendency of a substantive cause or matter. Originating motions are another means of commencing or initiating civil proceedings. This is used where an enactment specifies that a party may apply to a court for a relief. It is also used if the rules of court so require, for example application for judicial review, application for enforcement of human rights, application for habeas corpus.

<u>Purpose of Interlocutory Applications</u>

1. To expedite the trial or the action

2. To maintain the status quo ante whilst the action is pending

3. To prevent hardship to one or other of the parties

4. To prevent a party from overreaching or outwitting the opposite party

5. To protect the parties whilst awaiting the final outcome of the proceedings

6. To prevent any abuse of process during the proceedings

<u>Features of an Interlocutory Application</u>

The relief sought or prayers sought in an interlocutory application must flow from or within the scope of the claims in the substantive case. 

Every interlocutory order must terminate with the substantive case or an appeal.
The making of an interlocutory order which persists beyond the substantive case is bad in law. 

Interlocutory applications may be brought by either party at any stage of the proceedings and a stranger may also bring an interlocutory application to court e.g. application for joinder.

An application takes the form of a motion paper clearly stating the terms of the order or prayer sought by the applicant. It is supported by an affidavit stating the facts on which the person applying relies on. 

The affidavit contains the evidence supporting the application exhibits may be annexed to the affidavit and marked and attested to. The affidavit need not be deposed to by the party / applicant and there may be more than one affidavit to support an application. 

The applicant or party is bound by the facts contained in the affidavit and cannot be heard on any facts not deposed to in the affidavit. 

Where the applicant does not intend to rely on any facts in support of his application but relies on points of law or on materials already before the court, like pleadings, he need not file an affidavit.

*Bonsu v Eyifah [2001-2002] 1 GLR 19* 

A motion generally must state under what rule of court or law the motion is brought. 

<u>Types of motions</u>

1. Motion ex parte – this is where the other party to the suit is not put on notice. **Order 19 Rule 3**. And it is made where:

  * The rules of court provide so e.g. under order 4 if you are applying for substitution where a party dies the motion is made ex parte

  * Where there will be delay causing irreparable damage in going on notice e.g. Anton Piller orders (a court order which requires the defendant in proceedings to permit the plaintiff or his or her legal representative to enter the defendant’s premises in order to obtain evidence essential to the plaintiff’s case) and Mareva injunction (a court order freezing a debtor’s assets to prevent them being taken abroad).

  * Where the matter requires some urgency e.g. where someone is building on the land and will finish with 7 days and you want to stop him before he changes the character of the land

  * Where from the nature of the application there ought not to be any opposition to it e.g. where the defendant has not entered appearance and you want to take judgment based on that.

  * Where due to the stage of the proceedings the other party cannot be put on notice e.g. in an application for substituted service because you can’t find the party to serve.

Applications for motions ex parte include the following

1. Motion for leave to issue a writ of summons notice of which will be served outside the jurisdiction

2. Motion for leave to serve notice of writ outside the jurisdiction 

3. Motion for the renewal of a writ

4. Motion for change of parties by reason of death

5. Motion to serve third party notice

6. Motion to enter judgment in default of appearance 

7. Motion for garnishee order nisi

8. Motion for charging order nisi

9. Motion for interim injunction in urgent cases 

10. Motion for leave to issue a writ of possession or sequestration 

11. Motion for substituted service

On hearing the party on a motion ex parte the court may do any of the following

a.	Grant and make the order sought 

b.	Refuse the order

c.	The court may make an order that the other party appear before the court to show cause why the order sought should not be made or finally

d.	The court may order the motion to be made on notice to the parties to be affected by it

A party affected by an ex parte order has the right to apply to set it aside through a motion on notice. Ex parte orders are granted mainly for limited periods e.g. 10 days. 

2. Motion on notice

With this type of motion the opposite party is served, requesting him to appear at the hearing. Copies of the motion paper and the accompanying affidavit are served on the opposite party. Under **Order 19 Rule 2** there must be <span style="color:red;"**3 clear days** between the date of service of the notice of a motion and the hearing date</span> unless the court directs otherwise. 

A party put on notice may generally oppose the application at the hearing and may file an affidavit in opposition stating facts upon which he relies in opposing the order being sought. 

If the party opposes the application on points of law solely he need not file an affidavit in opposition. If no affidavit in opposition is filed and no point of law is raised, the facts in the supporting affidavit stand unchallenged.

Note that **Order 19 Rule 2(3)** allows a plaintiff to serve a writ of summons together with a motion on notice and this procedure is adopted when an order is urgently needed e.g. in an action for trespass the plaintiff may simultaneously file a motion of interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from continuing the trespass.
