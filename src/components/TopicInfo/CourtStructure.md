### Court structure 

There are two main courts

(1) Superior courts: 

 * Supreme Court
 * Court of Appeal
 * High Court / Regional Tribunal e.g. family, juvenile court.
 * Traditional institutions (same status as the High Court) 
    * Traditional Council
    * Regional House of Chiefs
    * National House of Chiefs

These are all courts of record with inherent jurisdiction.


(2) Lower courts:
 
 * Circuit Court 
 * District Court
 * Juvenile Court


Article 126 of the 1992 Constitution creates the superior courts specifically and then mandated Parliament to establish such other lower courts as is necessary. 

Parliament then enacted the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459) to establish the 3 lower courts. It enacted the Chieftaincy Act to establish the traditional institutions. The Traditional Council, Regional House of Chiefs and National House of Chiefs each have their own Judicial Committee, which makes determinations regarding traditional and chieftaincy issues.

#### Supreme Court

By Article 129 of the 1992 Constitution, the Supreme Court is the <u>final court of appeal</u> in Ghana and shall have appellate and other jurisdiction as may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by any other law.

**Composition**: detailed in Article 128 of the 1992 Constitution

>128 (1). The Supreme Court shall consist of the Chief Justice (C.J.) and not less than 9 other Justices 
of the Supreme Court.

>128 (2). The Supreme Court shall be duly constituted for its work by not less than 5 Supreme Court Justices except as otherwise provided in Article 133 of this Constitution

Article 130(1) of the 1992 Constitution grants the Supreme Court <u>exclusive original jurisdiction</u> in all matters relating to the enforcement and interpretation of the Constitution and in relation to whether an enactment was made in excess of the powers conferred onto Parliament. 

So if Parliament does anything in excess of its powers the Supreme Court is the place to go to quash it. 

The combined effect of Article 1(2) and Article 2 of the Constitution, which establish the supremacy of the 1992 Constitution, is that the court has the power to declare void any law found to be inconsistent with the Constitution.

* In _Sam (No 2) v Attorney General [2000] SCGLR 3057_ the court declared that:  

>‘It is clear that the jurisdiction under Article 2(1) (Enforcement of the Constitution) is a special jurisdiction **available to citizens of Ghana only** irrespective of personal interest.’ (emphasis added)

##### Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

* The Supreme Court has **appellate jurisdiction** from the Court of Appeal – i.e. it has jurisdiction to decide matters from the CA in both civil and criminal matters.

* The SC also has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to determine matters relating to the conviction of a person for high treason (i.e. to try and overthrow a government).    

* The SC also hears appeals from the Judicial Committee of the National House of Chiefs – Art 131 (4) of the Constitution. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court must first be sought from the Judicial Committee of the National House of Cheifs. 

* The SC also has **supervisory jurisdiction** over all courts and over any adjudicating authority – Art 132. See also _Republic v. High Court, Accra; Ex parte Darke XII (No 2) [1992]2 GLR 688-818_.

* It exercises this supervisory jurisdiction by means of writs of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, and quo warranto. Together these writs are known as prerogative writs: writs directing the behaviour of another arm of government, like a court. 

 * <u>Habeas Corpus</u>- produce the body; a recourse in law whereby a person can report an unlawful imprisonment or detention before a court. The court will then decide whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the person.

 * <u>Certiorari</u>- quashing order made to quash a decision or judgment made ultra vires, a decision made without observing natural justice, an error on the face of record. Made by a higher court to a lower court.

 * <u>Mandamus</u>- a party goes to court to compel a public officer to perform its duties; relates to public bodies performing public duties. An order issued by a higher court to compel or to direct a lower court or a government officer to perform mandatory duties correctly.

 * <u>Prohibition</u>- where a body is exercising a power it does not have, you apply for this order. It usually goes with a certiorari, you quash and prohibit him from continuing. Directing a subordinate to stop them from doing something the law prohibits.

 * <u>Quo warranto</u>- made to prevent a person from taking a position they are not to take. Requiring a person to show by what authority they exercise a power.

* The SC also has the exclusive jurisdiction in matters relating to the production of official documents in court – Art 135. 

* The SC also has **review jurisdiction** where the court can review its own decision- Art 133:

  * Rule 54 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (CI 16) provides grounds upon which the Supreme Court may review its previous decision:

         a. Proof of exceptional circumstances resulting in a grave miscarriage of justice – Refer to _In re Kwao (Decd); Nartey v. Armah [1989-90] GLR 546-550_. 

  b. Discovery of new matter or evidence that has come to light after the decision which with all due diligence had not been within the applicant’s knowledge or could not be produced by him earlier (i.e. at the time when the decision was made). 

 * In _In re Krobo Stool (No 2); Nyamekye (No 2) v. Opoku_, the court held that the lists of matters which might constitute exceptional circumstances were not exhaustive or closed; that the mere repetition of grounds of appeal which has been dismissed, was no justification for the granting of the review and that an applicant must show the existence of some fundamental and basic error affecting his substantial rights.

#### Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal has <u>no original jurisdiction</u>.  It exercises only appellate jurisdiction. 

The Court of Appeal has both a civil and criminal division.

Note that it is only civil cases from the Circuit Court that are dealt with by the Court of Appeal. Criminal cases from the Circuit Court go to the High Court.

Appeals lie as of right from a judgment, decree or order of the High Court or Regional Tribunals to the Court of Appeal - Article 137 (2). 

**Composition**: detailed in Art 136 of the 1992 Constitution

> 136 (1) The Court of Appeal shall consist of 

>(a) the Chief Justice;

>(b) subject to clauses (2) and (3) of this article, not less than ten Justices of the Court of Appeal; and

>(c) such other Justices of the Superior Court of Judicature as the Chief Justice may, for the determination of a particular cause or matter by writing signed by him, request to sit in the Court of
Appeal for any specified period.

>136 (2) The Court of Appeal shall be duly constituted by any 3 of the Justices referred to in Clause (1) of this Article, and when so constituted the most senior of the justices shall preside 

#### High Court

The High Court has **original jurisdiction** in all matters in civil and criminal cases unless an enactment states otherwise.

It also has **appellate jurisdiction** as conferred on it by the Constitution or any other law (Art 140 (5) of the 1992 Constitution). 

For instance, the High Court serves as an appellate court for appeals from the District Courts, Juvenile Courts and Family Courts in both civil and criminal matters, and appeals from the Circuit Court in criminal cases only. 

The High Court has appellate jurisdiction over all criminal matters emanating from the Circuit Courts, and all appeals from the District Courts, Juvenile Courts and Family Tribunals. 

The High Court also has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the fundamental human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in Chapter 5 of the Constitution ( Art 33 and 140(2) of the 1992 Constitution). 

If a party has a human rights issue, it can only be dealt with by the High Court. The Supreme Court only has jurisdiction in human rights cases if there is a public interest in hearing the case or a community right has been breached.

The High Court has **supervisory jurisdiction** over all lower courts and any lower adjudicating authority, and may in the exercise of this jurisdiction, issue orders and directions for the purpose of enforcing or securing the enforcement of its supervisory powers (Art 141 of the Constitution). It does this by use of prerogative writs.

The divisions in the High Court include: 

* the Fast Track Court
* the Commercial Court
* the Land Court 
* the Financial and Economic Crimes Court,
* the Human Rights Court and 
* the Maritime Court.

**Composition**: refer to Art 139 of the Constitution.

> (1) The High Court shall consist of -

>(a) the Chief Justice

>(b) not less than twenty Justices of the High Court; and

>(c) such other Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature as the Chief Justice may, by writing signed by him, request to sit as High Court Justice for any period.

>(2) The High Court shall be constituted -

>(a) by a single Justice of the Court; or

>(b) by a single Justice of the Court and jury; or

>(c) by a single Justice of the Court with assessors; or

>(d) by three Justices of the Court for the trial of the offence of high treason or treason as required by article 19 of this Constitution.

They are effectively District Courts which the Chief Justice has designated as a Juvenile Court.

They are composed of the Magistrate of the DC as the presiding person and two other persons, one of whom is a social welfare officer and the other a person of not less than twenty-five years of age both of whom shall be appointed by the Chief Justice on the recommendation of the Director of Social Welfare.

A Juvenile Court has power to hear and determine a matter civil or criminal that involves a person under the age of eighteen and shall for that purpose have and exercise the powers of a District Court.
