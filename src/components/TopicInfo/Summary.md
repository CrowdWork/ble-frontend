##Summary Judgment

**Order 14**

This allows a plaintiff to file for final judgment where the plaintiff thinks the defendant has no defence. This is after the defendant has appeared.

Summary judgment is a final judgment obtained without trial after the plaintiff has served a writ and statement of claim and the defendant has entered appearance, on the ground that the defendant has no defence to the action.

<u>Purpose</u>

The aim of summary judgment to enable a plaintiff who has served a writ and statement of claim on a defendant to obtain judgment without a trial provided he can prove his claim clearly by affidavit.

The judgment may be for the entire claim or part of the claim endorsed on the writ. For example, if it was a loan transaction and the plaintiff gave the defendant time to pay and the defendant admits that he owes the money but still doesn't pay, the plaintiff can issue a writ and when the defendant enters appearance the plaintiff can immediately file for summary judgment for the principal sum. It may be possible for the defendant to dispute the interest. 

### Conditions for Summary Judgment

1.The plaintiff must serve a writ and a statement of claim on the defendant. 
2. The defendant must have entered appearance.
3. The defendant must have no defence to the action.

### Method of application Order 14 Rule 2

1. The application is made by motion on notice.

2. Notice of the application shall set out the reliefs sought by the plaintiff.

3. The notice shall be supported by an affidavit verifying the facts on which the relevant claim or part of a claim is based. 

4. It shall state that in the deponent’s belief there is no defence to that claim or part of a claim, or no defence except as to the amount of any damages claimed.

5. Notice of the application, a copy of the affidavit in support and of any exhibits relied upon shall be served on the defendant not less than 4 clear days before the hearing date named in the notice.

6.This does not include the day the document is served. Time starts running from the next day. Note that weekends and holidays are not counted.


<u>What can a defendant who has been served with an application for Summary Judgment do?</u>

According to **Order 14 Rule 3**, a defendant may show cause against the application by an affidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Court. He may show:

  * That he has a good defence to the action on its merits; or
  * Disclose such facts as may be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend the action generally and also state whether the defence goes to the whole claim or part only of the plaintiff’s claim. 

If your client comes to you with the fact that he has been served with summary judgment and the client states that he has a defence, you can file an affidavit stating the defence that the client has; for instance you can raise the defence of capacity or the fact that the client is not liable. This then means there are triable issues. Court will then dismiss the application for summary judgment. 

It does not matter whether the defendant has filed a statement of defence or not. If the defendant has already filed a defence, then the defendant must file an affidavit as he has filed a Statement of Defence already. 

Bear in mind that sometimes defendants file a statement of defence when they enter appearance. The fact the defendant has filed a statement of defence does not necessarily mean the defendant has a defence; a plaintiff can still make an application for summary judgment. In such an instance, since the defendant has already filed a statement of defence, the only true way that the defendant can show cause against the application is by filing an affidavit. 


### Outcome of the application 

On hearing the application for Summary Judgment, the court may:

1. Give such judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant on the relevant claim or part of the claim unless the defendant is able to show that there is an issue in dispute which ought to be tried;

2. The court may give the defendant leave to defend the action with respect to the claim or part of it; either unconditionally or on such just terms such as giving security – that is, after the D has filed an affidavit, the court is of the opinion that summary judgment should not be granted but grant leave to the defendant to defend the action. The court may request that the D provides security. The security could be, for instance, a bond from a financial institution.

3. The court may dismiss the application with cost against the plaintiff if it appears that the case was not within **Order 14** in that the plaintiff knew that the defendant will rely on a contention that would entitle the defendant to an unconditional leave to defend the action.

By **Order 14 Rule 5(2)** the court may subject to conditions, stay execution of a judgment given against a defendant under Order 14 until after the trial of any counterclaim raised by the defendant

>For instance Y brings an action against D for 20,000 GH cedis. D files a statement of defence and a counterclaim; her counterclaim is that Y is supposed to render some services to her and she is asking for specific performance. If looking at the Statement of defence, D has no specific defence to Y’s claim, under Order 14 summary judgment can entered on Y’s claim. However, because of the counter claim, the court can or may stay execution of summary judgment until the counter claim is heard. Thus, if D is awarded damages, this can be used to offset any amount that D may be required to pay if the case is held in favour of Y. D can also take summary judgment on the counterclaim if she is of the opinion or believe that Y has no defence to the counter claim without going to trial. Even if the counterclaim is not related to the matter in anyway, the court may still stay proceedings. 

### Setting Aside Summary Judgment  **Order 14 Rule 9**

A judgment entered against a defendant who fails to appear at the hearing of an application for summary judgment under Order 14, may be set aside or varied by the court on terms as considers just. 

An application must be brought <style="color:red;"> within **14 days** of the service on the defendant of the notice of the judgment</span>. 

Take note, it is only a defendant who fails to appear a hearing who can set aside a judgment. That means if a defendant appears and judgment is entered against the defendant, the only remedy is to appeal; it cannot be set aside. 

###Summary judgment on counterclaim  **Order 14 Rule 10**

Where a plaintiff is served with a counter claim, the defendant at any time after the service of the counterclaim may apply for summary judgment against the plaintiff on grounds that the plaintiff has no defence to a claim made in the counter claim.

The rules apply to counter claims of a defendant in the same way as a plaintiff’s claim endorsed on a writ of summons. 

By **Order 14 Rule 11**, where judgment is taken under Order 14 for a claim, or a particular part of the claim, or a counter claim, the action may proceed to trial as regards any other claim not included in a judgment obtained summarily – this means there could be several claims endorsed on a writ or counterclaim and on some of those claims, the defendant may not have a defence so the plaintiff may take summary judgment on those claims and then the other issues will proceed to trial. 

<u>Actions excluded</u>

By **Order 14 Rule 12**, the following actions are excluded from summary judgment: 

1.	Probate, Matrimonial and Maritime proceedings 
2.	A claim or counterclaim for defamation, malicious prosecution, seduction, or breach of promise to marry
3.	Claim or counter claim based on allegation of fraud.  

With these actions you can't take summary judgment. 

The essence of summary judgment is to allow parties to take early shot at judgment without going to trial. 

*Yartel Boat Building Company v. Annan [1991] 2 GLR 11-16*

> The plaintiff took out a specially indorsed writ against the defendant for the balance of the contract price for work he >had done for the defendant.  The writ was not accompanied with a statement of claim.  On the same date, however, the >plaintiff filed summons for judgment against the defendant and in the supporting affidavit gave a detailed account of the >debt.  Both the writ and the summons for judgment were served on the defendant at the same time.  The defendant did not >enter appearance and was not represented at the hearing.

>Held, dismissing the application: 
> (1) Before the plaintiff could proceed under Order 52, r. 8 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. >140A) to serve his summons for judgment without leave of the court, it was a prerequisite that the writ must have been >served on the defendant and he must have failed to enter appearance within the time limited for such entry.  

>(2) Before the plaintiff could bring an application for summary judgment under Order 14 of L.N. 140A as amended by the >High Court (Civil Procedure) (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules, 1977 (L.I. 1129), 

>a. the defendant must have been served with a statement of claim; 
>b. the defendant must have entered an appearance; and 
>c. the affidavit in support of the application must not only depose to facts indicating that the plaintiff’s claim >was real and considerably unimpeachable but must also contain an averment that the defendant had no defence to the >action.  
>In the instant case, the plaintiff’s affidavit satisfied the rule.  

>However, since no statement of claim was served on the defendant, and the defendant had not entered appearance before the >plaintiff took out the summons for summary judgment, the procedure adopted by the plaintiff was clearly inadmissible >under Order 14 as amended.

There are different types of judgments:

1. Judgment in default of appearance (**Order 10**) – no time limit to set aside; must be done in ‘reasonable time’

2. Judgment in default of pleadings (**Order 13**) - no time limit to set aside; must be done in ‘reasonable time’

3. Judgment on admission (**Order 23**) 

4. Summary judgment (**Order 14**) – can only be set aside within 14 days after service of notice of the judgment by a party who did not appear at a hearing 

5.Judgment in default of trial  (**Order 36**) – where a case is fixed for hearing and you don't appear, if you are a defendant, the plaintiff would be asked to prove his case without you. If court enters judgment, you can <span style="colour:red;">set it aside within **14 days**</span>.

6. Consent judgment – this is where the parties have compromised and consented to a particular judgment. With this, no party can appeal. This cannot be set aside unless fraud is pleaded.

Note that judgements number one and two can always be set aside. 

Default of appearance is obtained <span style="color:blue;">ex parte</span>. To set aside judgment in default of appearance, you must go ex parte.
