### Pleadings

**Order 11**

Statements of fact which the parties exchange. They are the material facts which the parties seek to rely on to prove their claim or defending the action that have been brought against them. They assist the court in determining the issues involved in the claim.

Consist of : 

* Statement of Claim
* Statement of Defence
* Counterclaim
* Defence to Counterclaim
* Reply
* Rejoinder
* Further and better particulars of any of the above pleadings

Non-pleadings include: writ of summons and notice of appearance.

**Order 82 Rule 3** defines pleading as the “formal allegations by the parties to a law suit of their respective claims and defences with the intended purpose of providing notice of what is to be expected at the trial”.

Pleadings define the issues in controversy which the trial court is called upon to determine. They show the limits of the controversy. So an objection can be raised that a party is going outside their pleadings, raising issues that were not raised before. 

*Dam v Addo [1962] 2 GLR 200*

The aim of the pleadings is to give reasonable notice to the defendant, or with a counterclaim to the plaintiff, of the case they are expected to meet. The parties are thus informed why they are in court in the first place.

The pleadings record the issues in dispute, so the same disputants will not re-litigate on the same issues.

Pleadings are supposed to only contain material facts presented in a summary form.

According to **Order 11 Rule 10**, parties are bound by their pleadings. They are not allowed to plead or make allegations of fact that are inconsistent with their previous pleadings. Rule against departure. If you want to depart you must go for an amendment. You cannot unilaterally decide to depart from your pleadings.

*Dam v Addo [1962] 2 GLR 200*

*Hammond v Odoi [1982-83] GLR 1215*

*Bisi v Tabiri alias Asare [1984-86] 2 GLR 282*

*Nyamaah v Amponsah [2009] SCGLR 361*

*Adehyeman Industrial Complex v Ofosu Mensah [2010-2012] 2 GLR 37*

*Appiah v Tetsi [1982-83] GLR 1*

Rule in *Abowaba v Adeshina (1946) 12 WACA 18*: Now part of Civil Procedure Evidence. Parties are bound by their pleadings but if at a trial a party leads evidence which has not been pleaded it must be objected to. But if there is no objection to that evidence and it goes on record the court is bound to consider it. Court should only recuse/ refuse to consider that evidence if it is inadmissible e.g. hearsay. No appeal can be raised on the basis that evidence was lead that was no pleaded.

However, if a party leads evidence which was not pleaded and fails to amend their pleadings, it may lead situation in which they have put two cases before the court; one in their pleadings and one on the record of evidence. This may hurt their credibility.

*Akufo Addo v Catheline (1992) 1 GLR 377*

You plead facts NOT evidence. There is fine line between the two. E.g. There a contract between A and B. A accuses B of breaching the contract. The fact that B breached the contract should be put in the pleadings. What B did to breach the contract should not as that is evidence.

*Godka Group of Companies Ltd v PS International Ltd [1999-2000] 1 GLR 409* – they attached the site plan to the pleadings. It was struck out. The Court ruled that you cannot attach a document such as mortgage deed to pleadings.

Note that if a material fact that ought to be pleaded is not pleaded and evidence is led about it a the trial and that evidence is not objected to, the court will consider it in determining the issue in dispute – *Abowaba v Adeshina (1946) WACA 18*

You plead facts and NOT law. The law allows a party to raise a point of law e.g. pleading that the court has no jurisdiction or that the defendant has no capacity or that the claim is caught up in the statute of limitation or that the claim is estopped. For example you cannot plead that “this is contrary to Contracts Act 1997 section so so and so which states…” etc. If anything you should write "X did Y which is contrary to Contracts Act".

You can only plead law when it is customary law according **Order 11 Rule 11**. The custom being referred to, the geographical area where that custom holds and the nature and effect of that law MUST be pleaded. 

**Order 11 Rule 12**

Important -: Every pleading shall contain the necessary particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded including, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words,

* Particulars of any misrepresentation, negligence, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default, illegality or undue influence on which the party pleading relies; and

* Where a party pleading alleges any condition of the mind of any person, whether of any disorder or disability of mind or any malice, fraudulent intention or other condition of mind, except knowledge, particulars of the facts on which the party relies.

* Where it is necessary to give particulars of debt, expenses or damages and those particulars exceed three pages, 

If you claim illegality, estoppel, special damages you must also give particulars, res ipsa loquitur (the thing speaks for itself; a tort) e.g. most torts such as defamation you must give particulars of what was said.

<u>**Order 11 Rule 8**: Matters to be specifically pleaded</u>

It talks about pleadings subsequent to a statement of claim (e.g. defence, reply, counterclaim, defence to counterclaim etc.)

1. A party shall in any pleading subsequent to a statement of claim plead specifically any matter for example, performance, release, any limitation provision, fraud or any fact showing illegality:

	* Which the party alleges makes any claim or defence of the opposite party not maintainable; or
	* Which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise; or
	* Which raises issues of fact to arising out of the preceding pleading.

2. Without prejudice to sub rule (1), a defendant to an action for possession of immovable property shall plead specifically every ground of defence on which the defendant relies, and a plea that the defendant is in possession of the immovable property in person or by a tenant shall not be sufficient.

A writ of summons and a Notice of Appearance are NOT pleadings. Even though a writ is always to be accompanied by a statement of claim, by itself it is not a pleading.

### Form of Pleadings

1. Name of the court e.g. In the High Court Tema – AD 2016

2. The suit number e.g. Suit No L5/16

3. The name of the parties e.g. Kofi Mensah (Plaintiff *NOT claimant) v Ama Bonsu (Defendant)

4. The description of the pleading e.g. Statement of Claim/ Statement of Defence/ Counterclaim/ Reply to statement of defence.

5. Body of statement divided into paragraphs and numbered consecutively. Every paragraph must contain a specific allegation of fact

6. Dates, sums and numbers can be expressed in words, figures or both.

7. If the pleading is being prepared by the parties themselves it must be dated and signed by that party. If it is being prepared by a lawyer it must be dated and signed by that lawyer.

8. It must be addressed to the Registrar of the courts and to the opposite party below.

NB: There are other claims that require particulars to be provided, these include: negligence, defamation and misrepresentation.

<u>**Order 11 Rule 18**: Striking out Pleadings</u>

1. The court at any stage of the proceedings, may order any pleading or anything in the pleading to be struck out on the following grounds
    a. The pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence; or
    b. It is scandalous, frivolous or vexations; or
    c. It may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
    d. It is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.

The court may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly.

2. No evidence whatsoever shall be admissible on an application under sub rule 1(a) (no reasonable cause or action or defence is disclosed). The court will look at the pleadings as they are to determine whether they disclose a cause of action or if a viable defence is raised. 

*Ghana Muslims Representative Council v Salifu (1975) 2 GLR 246*

*Harlley v Edjurah Farm Limited (1977) 2 GLR 179*

###Delivery of Pleadings

A statement of claim is to be served together with a writ of summons. 

A defendant who files an appearance and intends to defend an action must file a statement of defence for service on the plaintiff <span style="color:red;">before the expiration of **14 days** after the time limited for appearance</span> (usually 8 days, so he has 14 days from the expiration of the 8 days).

You can file your statement of defence with your appearance though.

If you do not file a defence a judgment can be entered against you.

A plaintiff on whom a defence is served shall file a reply, if necessary, <span style="color:red;">before the expiration of **7 days** after the service of the defence</span>. A reply is usually necessary if the defendant raises new issues in his defence, for example, he is challenging the plaintiff’s capacity.

Writ + statement of claim --> entry of appearance by defendant (8 days) --> 14 days after the 8 days defendant files a statement of defence (they may also file a counterclaim) --> 7 days after the service of the defence the plaintiff files a reply if necessary (and a defence to the counterclaim)

After a reply no pleading shall be filed without the leave of the court. 

Pleadings may be filed during the legal vacation (1st August to 30th September) but time does not run during the vacation. **Order 80 Rule 2**. 

Appearance is not suspended though because appearance is not pleading. So you must enter an appearance within 8 days of receiving the writ and then file your defence 1st October. 

###Close of Pleadings   **Order 11 Rule 19**

Pleading closes <span style="color:red;">after the expiration of **7 days** after service of the reply<span>. If there is no reply but only a defence to a counterclaim, then pleading closes after service of the defence to the counterclaim. 

If neither reply nor a defence to a counterclaim is served then <span style="color:red;">pleadings close after the expiration of **7 days** after service of the defence</span>.

<span style="color:red;">**One month**</span> after close of pleadings the plaintiff shall file a notice of application for directions for service on all the parties in accordance with **Order 32**.

### Unpleaded pleadings

*Edward Nasser and Company Ltd v McVroom 1996-97 SCGLR 468*

*In Re Okine (Deceased); Dodoo v Okine 2003-2004 SCGLR 582*

###Statement of Claim

By **Order 2 Rule 6** and **Order 11 Rule 1**, every writ shall be filed together with a statement of claim.

When a writ is filed without a statement of claim, the defendant may apply to the court for the action to be dismissed.

The statement of claim must contain in summary form all the material facts which the plaintiff seeks to rely on to prove his/her claim.

It must disclose that a cause or action has arisen and accrued in every plaintiff if there is more than one plaintiff.

It must also show that there is liability on every defendant if there is more than one.

*Morkor v Kuma [1998-1999] SCGLR 620*  - there was an action against a company and the managing director was joined to the claim when the managing director had not personal liability. Under company law, the company itself is a legal entity that can sue and be sued; thus, unless the directors of the company have personal liability in the action, they cannot be joined. 

It is important to plead clearly whether the relief or remedy sought is sought jointly or jointly and severally or in the alternative; this must be indicated in the writ AND repeated in the statement of claim.
E.g. Wherefore the Plaintiff claims against the defendant jointly and severally or in he alternative the following:

* Recovery of the sum of GHc 500,000
* Interest on the sum
* Damages for breach of contract

Or

* In the alternative judicial sale of Plot No 7 Mango Street, Dansoman.

A statement of claim under **Order 11 Rule 15 (2)**, shall not contain any allegation in respect of a cause of action, unless that cause of action is indicated in the writ of summons or arises from facts which are the same or include or form part of facts giving rise to a cause of action so mentioned. In other words, the facts pleaded must relate to the claim or relief endorsed on the writ.




<u>Special rules</u>

1. Defamation

* **Order 57 rule 3(1)** in an action for libel or slander, the plaintiff is required to give particulars of facts and matters he relies on in support of his claim that the words or matter complained of are defamatory.

2. Money Lenders and Mortgage action

* **Order 59 Rule 3** outlines all the things that should be stated in a statement of claim in a moneylender’s or mortgage action. It must be stated exactly as outlined in the Rule. If the plaintiff has not stated what is required in line with the special rules can the statement of claim be cured? Yes. It can be amended according to Order 81: Effect of Non-compliance with rules. However if judgment has been entered and the defendant has suffered some loss or damage the judgment may be set aside.

3. Probate Action

* Order 66 Rule 40 (3) Where the plaintiff disputes the interest of the defendant in the probate action the plaintiff must state in the statement of claim that he denies the interest of the defendant.

<u>Structure of the statement of claim</u>

1. The name of the court

2. The name of the parties and their relationship (if they are related)

3. The nature of their business

4. The circumstance leading to the dispute

5. The rights of the plaintiff that has been violated or breached

6. The reliefs being sought by the plaintiff

7. It must be dated and signed by counsel/ the plaintiff himself if he is suing in person;

8. It must be addressed to the Registrar of the courts

9. It must be copied to the defendant and his lawyer

###Statement of Defence

A defendant who enters appearance must file a statement of defence <span style="color:red;">within **14 days** after the time limited for appearance</span> (which is 8 days after service).

** IMPORTANT** **Order 11 Rule 2 (2)** Where notice of application for summary judgment under **Order 14** is served on the defendant before the defendant files a defence, then the 14 days rule shall not apply until after the determination of the application for summary judgment.

The defendant in such a situation will be required to file a defence after the application has been determined within 14 days or within such time as the courts may order. The 14 day runs from the date the summary judgment is dismissed. If judgment is given then obviously there will be no need to file a defence.

**Order 9 Rule 8**: a defendant may at any time before filing appearance set aside a writ of summons if the writ is defective or the service of the writ is irregular.

But if a defendant enters conditional appearance then he can only set aside a writ or service of the writ by moving the Court <span style="color:red;">within **14 days**</span>. If the defendant does not enter appearance, he can move the court at any time.


<u>General rules of defence</u>

1. A defendant may admit part or all the fact alleged in the statement of claim.

   a. When a defendant makes an admission in his statement of defence of the claims then the plaintiff is at liberty to take judgment on his admissions (**Order 23 Rule 2(6)**: Admissions). 

   b. E.g. if the issue is a debt of 50,000 and the defendant admits owing 30,000, judgment can be taken on the 30,000 and the contested 20,000 will go to trial. 

2. A defendant may deny the facts in the statement of claim. A denial is known as ‘traverse’. Every denial must be specific (**Order 11 Rule 13**). If you do not deny specifically it will be deemed that you have admitted that fact, so avoid evasive denials.

3. In view of **Order 11 Rule 13(3)** a general traverse (denial) is allowed but it is not adequate. It must be specifically traversed. What you can do is traverse specifically where possible and then start or end your defence with a general traverse to catch any facts which you missed specifically addressing. *Ansah v Busanga [1976] 2 GLR 488*; *Brutuw v Afaribah [1982-83] GLR 464.* So generally the general traverse will be given effect where the allegations are answered partially leaving some unanswered.  In such a situation the general traverse will supplement or fill the gaps.

4. A plaintiff can deny allegations by stating that he joins issue with the defendant on his statement of defence. This means that he is denying all the allegations made - **Order 11 Rule 14**

5. Defendant can put up a defence of <span style="color:green;">**Confession and Avoidance**</span>. This is where the defendant admits the facts stated by the plaintiff but raise a point of law or matter which absolve him of liability. E.g. admit he drove into the plaintiffs car but says the plaintiff was crossing a red light/ acquiescence e.g. he is on plaintiffs land but plaintiff knew about it/ yes he breached the contract but the breach was brought about by something out of his control.

6. <span style="color:green;">**Defence of Set off**</span> –  **Order 11 Rule 17** Different from a counter claim, which is an action. This is a defence. In an action of a liquidated claim of money, a defendant who has a cross claim for a sum of money may include it in his defence as a set off against the plaintiff’s claim. 

a. Parties must be in the same capacities for the set off to operate e.g. they must each be suing each other in their personal names e.g. A as a customary successor sues B in his personal capacity and A owes B money personally. B cannot set off the money A owes him personally as in this instance A is suing as a customary successor. 

b. The amount to be off set must either extinguish the debt or reduce it. The set off cannot be greater than the amount the plaintiff is claiming. That should be a counter claim.

c. The set off must be specifically pleaded in the defence to be relied upon.

7.	Defence of tender before action - Order 11 Rule 16

* If a defendant desires to rely upon this defence, then he must show that he tendered the amount owed and the plaintiff rejected it. He must pay the money into court and give notice to the plaintiff of the payment.

* Defence of tender is a defence at common law and applied to liquidated claims. It is a good defence to an action to recover debt. It cannot however be pleaded as a defence to a claim of unliquidated damages.

* This defence is available to parties in a liquidated claim and the party makes an attempt to pay but the plaintiff refuses to accept the money because he has already started an action in court.

With a defence you can raise issues of capacity, jurisdiction, limitation, estoppel and res judicata.

### Reply

A plaintiff on whom a defence is served shall file a reply if it is necessary within <span style="color:red;">**7 days** after the defence is served</span>.

If no reply is filed to a statement of defence, then there shall be joinder of issue on the statement of defence. **Order 11 Rule 14**

A reply is however necessary where a counterclaim is filed together with the statement of defence, because the plaintiff must incorporate a defence to counterclaim in the reply.
*Agbosu v Kotey [2003-2004] SCGLR 420*

The main purpose of the reply is to raise answers to specific defences pleaded in a statement of defence.

A plaintiff may allege facts in his reply in support of his case as contained in the statement of claim, but he is not allowed to set out in his reply a new claim or an entirely new cause or action which was not contained in his writ and statement of claim.

A plaintiff however can do the following in a reply
* Admit such portions of the statement of defence, which he considers proper to admit.
* Allege or raise facts to defeat specific defences contained in the statement of defence. For example, if the defendant raises the defence of bona fide purchaser a plaintiff can reply that the purchase was not bona fide. Again, in an action for defamation, if a defendant pleads the defence of fair comment, the plaintiff can reply that the comment was made out of malice. If the defendant raises the defence of capacity or jurisdiction, a plaintiff will necessarily have to file a reply to explain or answer the claim made by the defendant. 

*Odoi v Hammond [1971] 1 GLR 375* 
*Duah v Debra [1967] GLR 456*

### Rejoinder

A rejoinder allows the defendant to present a more responsive and specific statement challenging the allegations made against him by the plaintiff. 

Rejoinder can only be filed upon leave of the court. In other words, after a reply a party can only file a pleading with the leave of the court. 

###Close of Pleadings

Pleadings in a case are deemed to close <span style="color:red;">**7 days** after service of reply or defence to a counterclaim</span>. 

If no reply or defence to counterclaim is served then pleadings will close 7 days after service of defence.

###Counterclaim

**Order 12**

A defendant who alleges that he has any claim or is entitled to any relief or remedy against a plaintiff in an action in respect of any matter, may instead of bringing a fresh action or separate action, make a counterclaim in respect of that matter.

A defendant shall add the counterclaim to his statement of defence. 

The counterclaim must be a claim for which the defendant could have sued as a plaintiff in a separate action and it must be a claim for which the court in which the plaintiff has begun the action has jurisdiction.

A counterclaim is a cross action, independent on its own and can be pursued even if the plaintiff’s action is dismissed.

A defendant who has a counterclaim has all the rights of a plaintiff in an action. For example if the plaintiff does not file a defence to the counterclaim, the defendant can take default judgment in default of defence in the counterclaim against the plaintiff. So a plaintiff on whom a defendant serves a counterclaim shall file a defence to the counterclaim if he intends to defend it.

Where a plaintiff intends to serve both a reply and a defence to counterclaim, the plaintiff shall include them in the same document.

E.g.

       IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE

           LAND COURT DIVISION  

                              SUIT NUMBER

    MR X                      PLAINTIFF

    MR Y                      DEFENDANT

    -------------------------------------
      REPLY AND DEFENCE TO COUNTERCLAIM
    -------------------------------------


A defence to the counterclaim shall be served on the defendant within 14 days after the service on the plaintiff of the counterclaim.

<u>Proceedings on counterclaim</u>

A counterclaim may be proceeded with although a judgment is given for the plaintiff in the action, or the action is stayed, discontinued or dismissed.

Where a defendant establishes a counterclaim against the claim established by the plaintiff and there is a balance in favour of one of the parties, in liquidated claims for example, the court may give judgment for the balance. 
*Progressive Import Ltd v Muller [1991] 1 GLR 94* 

<u>Counterclaim against additional parties<u>

If a defendant who makes a counterclaim against the plaintiff alleges that any other person, whether a party to the action or not is liable to the defendant together with the plaintiff in respect of the subject matter of the counterclaim, or claims against such persons any relief relating to or connected with the original subject matter of the action the defendant may join that other person as a party against whom the counterclaim is made. Order 12 Rule 5

If the defendant joins a person as a party against whom the defendant makes a counterclaim, the defendant shall add that person’s name to the title of the action and serve that person a copy of the counterclaim.

E.g     
        IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE
              LAND DIVISION
             ACCRA A.D. 2017
		
                         SUIT NO 17/17
		
   MR KOFI MENSAH		PLAINTIFF
	AND	
   MR YAW AMOFA		        DEFENDANT
	AND	
   MRS AMA DANKWA		DEFENDANT BY COUNTERCLAIM
   
        -----------------------------------------		
          STATEMENT OF DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM
        -----------------------------------------
           

Where a counterclaim is to be served on a person not already a party to the action a copy of the writ and any pleadings filed with the action shall be served with the counterclaim. 

The rules on the service of process or filing of pleadings shall apply equally to a counterclaim and proceedings arising from it as if the counterclaim were a writ and a statement of claim and the proceedings arising from it, an action; and the party making the counterclaim a plaintiff and the party against whom it is made, a defendant in the action. 

Where a counterclaim is to be served on a person not already a party to the action, the counterclaim shall be endorsed with a notice addressed to that person stating the effect of **Order 9 Rule 1 and 2**, which requires the entry of appearance and the effect of not entering an appearance. (Provided for on template).

A person who is not already a party in the action shall become a party to the action from the time of service of the counterclaim on him and shall file an appearance to the counterclaim.

If a counterclaim joins two or more causes of action and it appears to the courts that a joinder of cause of action may embarrass or delay the trial or inconvenience the parties, the court may order separate trials.

If it appears on an application of any party against whom a counterclaim is made that the subject matter of the counterclaim for any reason ought to be disposed of by a separate action, the court may order the counterclaim to be struck out or be tried separately. Where the case is tried separately the same pleadings can be used.

###Default of pleadings / Default of Defence

**Order 13**

For liquidated demands, final judgment will be taken against the defaulting party as well as costs. Order 13 Rule 1

For unliquidated claims, interlocutory judgment may be entered against the defaulting party, <span style="color:pink;">**with leave**</span> of the court, then a date is set to assess damages. Order 13 Rule 2

For a claim in detinue you enter interlocutory judgment for 
* the delivery of the goods or their assessed value and costs or 
* for the delivery of the goods alone and costs or 
* for the value of the goods and costs.
**Order 13 Rule 3**

In a claim for immovable property you take judgment for possession of the immovable property and costs. **Order 13 Rule 4**

Note that where there is more than one defendant, judgment taken for recovery of possession shall not be enforced against any defendant unless judgment for possession of the property has been entered against all the defendants. Also take note that this rule does not apply where possession is claimed under a mortgage.

Mixed claims: The plaintiff or party entitled to judgment shall enter such judgment as entitled to enter under the rules as provided. **Order 13 Rule 5**

Other claims not specified by the rules **Order 13 Rule 6(1)**: the plaintiff shall apply for judgment and upon hearing the application the court may give such judgment as the court appears entitled to. However under **Order 13 Rule 6 (3)** if the claim is against more than one defendant, and one defendant fails to file a defence, the plaintiff may 

a. if the claim against the defendant in default is severable from the claim against the other defendants, then the plaintiff may apply for judgment and proceed against the other defendants or

b. set down the action on a motion for judgment against the defendant in default at the time when the action is set down for trial

*In all these cases of default judgment the court will only grant the judgment upon proof of service of the writ and statement of claim after which the defendant has failed to file a defence OR the plaintiff has been served a counterclaim and has failed to provide a defence to the counterclaim. Proof of service is vital.

<u>Default to counterclaim</u>

A counterclaim is treated as a statement of claim and as such the rules that apply to default of pleadings apply to default of counterclaim.

<u>Money Lenders Action  **Order 59 Rule 4**</u>

Default judgment can only be applied for with the leave of the court and the application for leave shall be on notice to the party who has defaulted.

Upon hearing the application the court may grant leave to the plaintiff to enter final judgment for the whole amount or part of the claim.

<u>Mortgage Action **Order 59 Rule 5**</u>

Judgment in default of defence shall not be entered except with the leave of the court and the application for leave shall be on notice to the defendants.

<u>Maritime Action</u> 

Where no appearance has been filed in a maritime action then, upon the filing of an affidavit proving due service of the writ, verifying the facts on which the action is based together with the statement of claim, a plaintiff may apply for judgment in default of appearance. **Order 62 Rule 15 (2)**

In the same vein where the defendant fails to file a defence, the plaintiff may apply for judgment upon filing an affidavit stating that no defence has been served on the plaintiff as well as filing an affidavit verifying the facts on which an affidavit is based and attaching a copy of the statement of claim. **Order 62 Rule 15 (4)**

**Order 62 Rule 15 (8)**: the court may set aside or vary any judgment entered under the rule and by Order 62 Rule 15 (9) the general rules on judgment on default of appearance and judgment in default of defence under Order 10 and Order 13 do not apply to maritime cases.

###Probate Action **Order 66 Rule 42**

The court does not grant default judgment in probate actions. After a defendant has failed to file a pleading the plaintiff may apply for leave to set down the action for trial.

###Setting aside Judgment in Default of Pleadings  **Order 13 Rule 8**

The court may on application by a party affected by such judgment set aside or vary any such judgment on such terms as it deems fit. 

The only ground for setting aside a default judgment is that the party against whom the judgment was entered has a reasonable defence to the action. 

There is no time bar in an application to set aside a default action. You must simply move the court within a reasonable time.

*Gbagbo v Owusu [1972] 2 GLR 52*
The plaintiff who claimed ownership of a plot of land sold to the defendant, sued the vendor, the applicant in this action, for a declaration of title. The vendor entered appearance through his solicitors and later left the country. The defendant was therefore substituted for the vendor following an application to the court by the plaintiff. Judgment was given against the defendant in default appearance. The vendor came back to Ghana and then applied to have the judgment set aside.

Held: it is well established that there are only two methods whereby a stranger to a judgment who is adversely or injuriously affected can set aside. That is, he can obtain the defendant’s leave to use the defendant’s name and then apply in the said name to have the judgment set aside. Or where he cannot use the name of the defendant. He can take out a summons in his own name to be served on both the plaintiff and the defendant, asking to have the judgment set aside and for him to intervene. Since the applicant did not obtain the defendant’s permission to use her name his application could not be entertained.
