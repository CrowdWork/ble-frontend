### Service of a Writ of Summons 

**Order 7**

This is done by bailiffs ( who are employees of the judicial service) or process servers registered with the Court (private companies franchised to effect service of court processes by the CJ), however a party may direct service.

Generally, every writ is to be served by personal service unless otherwise provided by the rules, **Order 7 Rule 2** It is a duplicate of the writ that must be handed over to the Defendants. 

If the individual proves difficult, the Order 7 Rule 2(2) states that the person effecting service must ‘leave the writ as near that person as may be practicable’. 
This means a bailiff can even can throw the writ as close to the Defendant as possible and then file an affidavit to prove service. _Barclays Bank v Ghana Cables [1998-1999] SCGLR 1_

<u>**Documents not served personally**</u>

There are certain processes where the rules do not require personal service. **Order 7 Rule 4** provides instructions on how service of such documents may be effected in such cases:

1.	by leaving it at the proper address of the person to be served

2.	By serving it by registered post bearing a return address

3.	by any other method that the court would direct

<u>**Modes of substituted service**</u>

**Order 7 Rule 6(1)** states if a plaintiff makes three or more attempts at personal service without success and further attempts to effect personal service may result in <u>undue delay</u> or where <u>it is impracticable to effect personal service</u> that plaintiff can make an application for substituted service.

An application for substituted service is made by a <span style="color:blue;">motion ex parte</span> and shall be supported by an affidavit stating the facts upon which the application is based. (**Order 7 Rule 6(2)**)

A plaintiff can't apply for substituted service for someone outside the jurisdiction. 

Generally, in order to effect substituted service, all a Plaintiff must do is to take such steps as the Court may direct to bring the document to the notice of the person to be served.

However, notwithstanding the above rule, the Court may direct Substituted service to be effected in the following ways:

1. By service in accordance with **Order 7 rule 4** (detailed above)

2. By delivering the writ to an agent of the person to be served or some other person, if there are reasonable grounds that through that person the writ will get to the defendant. 

3. By sending the writ by registered post to the person to be served at an address specified in the affidavit supporting the application

4. By notice posted on the Court’s notice board in the area where the defendant resides or at any public place in the region in which the cause or matter is commenced or at the usual known or last known place of residence or business of the person to be served

5. By advertising in the media within the jurisdiction

_Kombat v. Bediako (1971) 1 GLR PG 196_:

>On the same day as the applicants issued a writ of summons accompanied by a statement of claim they applied by an ex parte motion for substituted service of the writ and statement of claim by prepaid registered post upon the third defendant under the authority of Order 10, r. 1 (e).  The address of the third defendant was indorsed on the writ but the addresses of the first and second defendants were not indicated.  On the face of the affidavit, however, it was not clear whether the third defendants knew the addresses of the first and second defendants.  The court raised the question of whether a writ on which the address of a defendant had not been endorsed could be the subject-matter of an application for substituted service and whether it was proper to proceed ex parte.

>Held:

(1) Substituted service could only have been resorted to where personal service could not have been effected for reasons stated with great particularity in an affidavit.  It is inexpedient (unadvisable) to order substituted service in the absence of the address of the defendant, which is an essential feature of the writ. 

(3) Since the third defendant was in effect being asked to serve the writ for the applicants, it was only fair and just that the application be made on notice.

<u>**How to effect service on particular persons Order 7 Rule 5**</u>

1. **Corporate Bodies** - Can serve the writ on the chairman of the board, managing director or any other senior officer of the company. Sometimes company secretaries are actually companies so you can serve on them. _Tabury v Ghana Commercial Bank_ and _Ghana Cables v Barclays Bank 1997-98 SCGLR 1_

2. **Stool or Skeins**: When a stool or a skin is named as a defendant, the writ can be served on the occupant of the stool or skin. It can also be served on the secretary to the stool. The clerk or linguist of the stool or skin. Where the stool is vacant the writ can be served on the regent or caretaker. 

3. **Family under customary law**: If the defendant is family or clan, writ must be served on the head of the family or any member of the family acting as the caretaker of the family property. A principal member of the family can also be served. 

4. **Persons in prison**: Can serve a writ on the person in charge of the prison where a person is in custody, or any guard or officer of the prison where the defendant has been detained.

5. **Minister or departmental head in their official capacity**: Serve the writ on the administrative head of their ministry or department.

6. **Persons in security services**: They must be served through their commanders whether they are being sued in their official or personal capacity.

9. **Person with a disability** as defined under Order 5 Rule 9 (i.e. Under the age of 18 or other disability): Must serve writ on parents or guardians or the person with whom they reside.

<u>**Computation of time for service**</u>

* Time starts running on the date of which service is effected on the defendant. E.g. if you are served today, time starts running today. 

* If a document is served through the post, and the document is not returned as ‘not delivered’, the document is deemed to have been served on that person <span style="color:red;">**21 days** after the day of posting that letter</span>. 

* If a writ is served a defendant has <span style="color:red;">**8 days**</span> to make an appearance at court.

* The time for service of writ of service and court processes is 6am to 6pm.

_Republic v High court Koforidua ex parte Osaye Akonor [2009] SCGLR 573_

###Service outside the jurisdiction 

**Order 8**

Generally no writ shall be served out of the jurisdiction. Leave must be sought to issue such a writ, notice of which is to be served outside the jurisdiction. 

Secondly, leave must be sought to serve notice of a writ out of the jurisdiction as well.

An application for grant of leave to issue notice of a writ shall be supported by an affidavit stating the grounds on which the application is made and stating that

* in the deponent’s belief, the plaintiff has a good cause of action, and 
* showing in what place or country the defendant is or may probably be found.

No such leave shall be granted unless it is made clear to the Court 
* That the case is a proper one for service out of the jurisdiction; and
* That the case falls within one of the provisions of Rule 3.
* **Order 8 Rule 3** outlines the cases where leave to issue notice of a writ may be granted by the Court.

An order granting leave to serve notice of a writ out of the jurisdiction shall provide a time limit within which the defendant to be served shall file an appearance.


###Mode of service

If there is a civil procedure convention between Ghana and the country where the person resides then the mode of service is through the Ghana consul or the judicial authorities of that country. An official certificate will be sent to the Ghanaian Court stating that the document has been served on the person personally or in accordance with the laws of that country on a specified date and this shall be evidence of the facts so stated.

If there is no convention then the writ will be served through the government of that country if they are willing or through the Ghana consul if the laws of that country allows diplomats to effect service.

If there is an agent within the jurisdiction a plaintiff can serve a writ under **Order 7 Rule 13** (Service of writ on agent of principal outside Ghana) by first seeking an order from the Court allowing them to do so. The writ should be served on the agent. A copy of the order and of the writ shall be sent by registered post to the defendant at the address of the defendant outside Ghana if known.

**Order 7 Rule 15**: where a writ is endorsed with a relief of possession of immovable property and the court is satisfied that there is nobody in occupation or in possession, then service of a writ on a defendant can be posted or affixed on a conspicuous part of the property and service will be deemed effective. 

To serve a photocopy of a writ it must be endorsed by the Registrar as a true copy.


###Setting aside a writ of summons

A writ may be set aside if it is defective under the following circumstances:

1. Where no parties are named on the writ

2. Where the party has no capacity

3. Where the writ does not disclose any cause of action.

4. Where the writ is filed in a court which has no jurisdiction.

5. Where the writ is not endorsed with a substantive claim

6. Where the writ is not accompanied by a statement of claim

7. Where the conditions precedent before the issue of the writ are not complied with. For example where leave needs to be sought before issuing the writ.

8. Where the writ is expired and it is served.

_R v High Court Tema ex parte Spirits_

_Accam v Gbettey [2013-2014] SCGLR 343_

>If a lawyer wants to sue for fees he must give 30 days notice. If he does not do this a writ issued will be defective.

###Setting aside service of a writ

Where a writ is not defective and it is wrongly served on a defendant, the person serving may apply **to set aside the service NOT the writ**, because the courts can order or redirect the proper service of the writ.  If service is set aside the writ can be re-served.

_State v Asantehene Divisional Court B1 Ex parte Kusada [1963] 2 GLR 238-276_

Service of a writ may be defective in the following instances:

1. If the writ is served on the wrong person

2. If the method of service for that document is incorrect e.g. where the document was supposed to be served personally but it was left at the proper address of that person or sent by registered post.

3. If notice of the writ is served outside of the jurisdiction without leave of the Court

4. Where service on particular persons e.g. a company/ stool or skin/ family under customary law etc. is not effected in accordance with CI 47 rules Order 7 Rule 5

5. Where the defendant is fraudulently induced into the jurisdiction for the sole purpose of serving him with the writ.
