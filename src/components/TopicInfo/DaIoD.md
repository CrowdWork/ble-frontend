### Discovery and Inspection of Documents 

**Order 21**

It is the process by which a party in an action may compel the disclosure of important documentary evidence in possession of the opponent to enable the party to prepare sufficiently for the trial.

Discovery may be carried out under three forms:

1. The disclosure of important information in writing in custody or possession or power of the opponent
 
2. The inspection of a disclosed writing for evidential purposes 

3. The production of the writing to the adversary or the courts for copies to be taken thereof.

Parties to an action naturally may be unwilling to disclose information that may adversely affect their case in court. Discovery under the rules of court allows a party to call upon or compel the unwilling party to make disclosure of all relevant information in that party’s possession or control and allow for inspection of such information. The rule of discovery therefore eliminates surprises in civil trials and gives all the parties an even playing field. 

The process of discovery begins with mutual discovery between the parties as provided under **Order 21 Rules 1 and 2**. This rule provides that after close of pleadings a party shall within 14 days make and file for service on the other party a list of documents which are in that party’s possession, custody or power and which would relate to any matter or issue between the parties to be discovered and for inspection.

Under **Order 21 Rule 6** the court under application by any party shall make an order ordering that a party or any of them shall make discovery of such document or such matters in question as may be specified in the order. Whenever the court is satisfied that discovery is not necessary, no such order for discovery shall be made.

Under **Order 21 Rule 3** however, any party may apply at the stage of the application for directions for such discovery as is necessary and the Court may order the respondent to serve a list of documents in its custody or possession on the applicant. 

The court may order discovery even after the application for direction stage if reasonable cause is shown and as indicated the court will only order discovery when satisfied that the discovery is necessary to dispose fairly the cause or matter and will save costs. 

Under **Order 21 Rule 7**, a party who serves a list of documents on the other party in compliance with a Court order shall at the same time serve notice on the other party stating a time **within 7 days** after the service of the notice when that party may inspect and take copies of the document, other than any document to which the party objects to produce, and the notice must specify a place for the inspection.

**Order 21 Rule 8** allows a party at any time to serve notice on the other party in whose pleading or affidavit reference is made to a document to produce the document for inspection of the party giving the notice and to permit copies to be made of the document. 

When a party fails to serve the notice or objects to produce any document for inspection or offers inspection at an unreasonable time or place, the Court may upon application by the party entitled to the inspection make an order for production of the document in question for inspection at such time and place and in a manner it deems fit.

<u>Failure to comply with order of discovery</u>

When a party fails to comply with an order for discovery of documents or to produce any document or record for purpose of inspection or fails to comply with the rules under Order 21, the Court may make such orders as it thinks fit and just including the following:

a. The action may be dismissed

b. The defence is struck out and judgment entered accordingly

c. Where the document is favourable to the defaulting party’s case, the party may not be allowed to use the document at the trial except with the leave of the court.

d. Where the document is not favourable to the party’s case the party may be committed for contempt

Note that under **Order 21 Rule 14 (2) and (3)** service of an order for discovery or production of documents on the lawyer of the party required to comply is sufficient service to ground an application for committal of the disobeying party and where an order is served on a lawyer who fails to give notice of it to his client without reasonable cause, that lawyer shall be liable for committal for contempt.
