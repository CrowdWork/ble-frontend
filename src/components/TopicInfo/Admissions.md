### Admissions 

**Order 23**  

In the pleadings filed in court a party may admit an allegation or a claim. An admission therefore to a claim, either wholly or partly, puts to an end the controversy that has brought the parties to court. A party in whose favour an admission is made is released of the burden of proving the fact alleged in the pleading. 

An admission may also narrow the dispute in controversy and help in the speedy trial in the case. Under **Order 23 Rule 1** a party is required to admit the truth of all or part of an opponents pleading. The mode of the admission could be in a letter before or after the initiation of the action in court. 

A party may also request the opponent to admit a particular fact or the authenticity of a document which is relevant to the proceedings in court. This is done by serving a Request to Admit Facts â€“ Form 12. **Order 23 Rule 2(1)**

*Ewusie Mensah v Ewusie Mensah [1992] 1 GLR 271*

Where a request is made to a party to admit a fact or the authenticity of a document the party served with the request has 14 days to respond (either to admit or deny). If the party fails to respond they shall be deemed, for the purposes of the cause or matter only, to admit the truth of the facts or the authenticity of the documents mentioned in the request  to admit. 

<u>Effect of Admission</u>

When a party admits a fact or authenticity of a document, any party in whose favour the admission is made is entitled to apply for a judgment or an order in respect of the admission without waiting for the determination of the other issues joined in the action. 

Where a defendant admits part of a liquidated claim the plaintiff is entitled to apply for judgment on that part of the claim admitted. It is important to bear in mind that to be able to sign judgment on admissions the admission should be clear and without any reservation. 

If the admission so stated leaves some issues to be argued or tried the court may not enter judgment. 

*Social Security Bank v Biney [1997-98] 2 GLR 886* 
*Pomaa v Fosuhene (1987-88) 1 GLR 244* 
*Adjavon v Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation (1980) GLR 135*

The application for judgment on admission should not be made after hearing has commenced. *Kofi III v Akrasi [1992-93] GBR 1012*

An application for judgment on admission should be by motion (and affidavit if necessary) and not by oral application. *Michelletti Polla v Crabbe [1976] 1 GLR 108*

An admission made in response to admit or an admission under Rule 2, or an admission in a pleading may be withdrawn on consent or with leave of the Court. **Order 23 Rule 5**
