Under s 9 of the Oaths Act 1972 (N.R.C.D. 6), the Chief Justice and other justices of the superior court, a circuit judge, district magistrate, the judicial secretary, a notary public and a commissioner for oaths are empowered to take lawful oaths or take a lawful affirmation which may be required to be taken for the purpose of complying with the laws of Ghana. 

Section 10 (1) of the Oaths Act: Taking of oaths out of the Republic: An affidavit or an oath required for a matter in the country or a registration of an instrument may be made outside the country before a person having an authority to administer oaths in that country and by s 10 (2) judicial and official notice shall be taken of the seal or signature of that person affixed to the oath or affidavit. 

By section 11(1) of the Oaths Act an ambassador, a High Commissioner, minister, diplomatic agent and consular officer of the Republic of Ghana in a foreign country has the authority to administer oaths and affidavits as done before persons authorised to do so in the Republic.

<u>Formal requirements of affidavits</u>

Affidavits shall bear the title of the suit or action and where the action has more than one title it will be sufficient to state the title of the first matter with the word ‘and other matters’. 

Where there is more than one plaintiff or one defendant it will be sufficient to state the name of the first followed by the words ‘and others’ or ‘and another’. 

The affidavit shall be printed, written or typed and shall be numbered consecutively. It shall be expressed in the first person ‘I’ or ‘We’. 

The affidavit should state the place of residence and the occupation of the deponent. 

The affidavit shall be divided into paragraphs and numbered consecutively. Each paragraph being as far as possible, confined to a distinct portion of the subject. 

Dates, sums and other numbers may be expressed in an affidavit in figures or words or both. The affidavit must be signed by the deponent and the jurat to be completed and signed the person before whom it is sworn. The jurat must state the full address of the place where the affidavit was sworn, the date on which it was sworn and the name and title of the person before whom it was sworn. 

If the deponent is an illiterate or blind there should be another jurat swearing that the document has been read and explained in a language that they understand and they have thus signed [Illiterates Protection Act 1912]. 

*Duodoo and Others v Adomako and Adomako [2012] 1 SCGLR 198*: by this authority even if there is no second jurat it does not invalidate the transaction automatically, so long as evidence can be produced that the deponent understood the nature of the transaction.

<u>Illiterate or blind deponent</u>

Where an affidavit is deposed to by an illiterate or a blind person there should be a certificate in the jurat by the person administering the oath that 

a.	The affidavit was read to the deponent in the presence of the person administering the oath and 

b.	That the deponent seems perfectly to understand the content thereof and

c.	That the deponent  signed or marked the affidavit in the presence of the person administering the oath.

An affidavit deposed to by a blind or illiterate person, without the certificate shall not be used in evidence unless the court is satisfied that it was read to and appeared to be perfectly understood and approved by the deponent. 

<u>Contents of Affidavit</u>

**Order 20 Rule 8**

Affidavits must contain only facts that the deponent can prove unless the Rules provide that it may contain a statement of information or belief or both. 

*Ibrahim v Abu Bakari [2001-2002] 1 GLR 540*
*Armah v Addoquaye [1972] 1 GLR 109*

<u>Filing of an Affidavit</u>

Every affidavit used in court proceedings shall be filed in the Registry of the courts in which the proceedings are pending. An affidavit shall be endorsed with a note showing on whose behalf it is filed and with the date of filing. [Affidavits which are filed with motions on notice do not need this as the address of the court etc and the parties will be on the motion. However if it is an affidavit in response it will not be accompanied by a motion so you need to add it].

<u>Documents exhibited to affidavits</u>
