## Venue of proceedings 

**Order 3**

The rules provide that when a plaintiff is commencing an action and the subject of the action deals with land or property, the action must be commenced in the region where the land is located. 

When the action involves movable property that has been seized or destrained then the action must be commenced in the region where the seizure took place. 

When the action is against a public officer to recover a penalty, then the action must be commenced where the cause of action arose.

When the action relates to breach of contract or specific performance it must be commenced in the region where the contract was supposed to be performed or where a defendant resides or carries on business.

If the  cause or action is outside of the four situations described above then usually you issue the writ in the region where the defendant resides.

The mere fact that an action has been commenced in the wrong venue does not nullify the proceedings. If the defendant does not raise an objection to the venue the court can continue with the case. If a defendant raises an objection he must do it before or on the date he files a statement of defence. After the defence has been filed it is up to the discretion of the court to transfer or not.

When the objection is raised the Court will stay proceedings and report the commencement of the proceedings at the wrong venue to the Chief Justice so s/he can transfer it to the right court. 

The Court can also report suo muto to the Chief Justice that in its opinion the proceedings ought to be transferred and the Chief Justice orders the transfer. 

If whilst the case is pending at the wrong venue the Court makes certain orders, those orders are valid not withstanding the transfer of venue. The orders remain valid until they are set aside.  Even void orders are valid unless set aside. 

Do not try and set aside a writ which has been commenced in the wrong court. You raise the objection in your defence or enter a conditional appearance, make a motion for the action to be stayed pending transfer to the correct court.
